美称中国海军首次可核威慑美本土 正研更强核潜艇 <br><br>

2013年11月12日  中国新闻网 <br><br>
据美国《防务新闻》网站11月11日报道，美国国会的一份涉华报告指出：中国的海基战略核武器将第一次进入IOC阶段(具备初始作战能力)，这是中国第一次具备这种能力。<br><br> 

美国国会下属的美中经济安全审查委员会的报告指出，中国巨浪-2潜射弹道导弹在今年晚些时候将进入IOC阶段(具备初始作战能力)。 <br><br>

巨浪-2导弹射程7400公里，这让中国海军首次拥有了可以直接对美国本土进行核威慑的能力。巨浪-2导弹部署于094型晋级核潜艇，在2020年前，中国将至少部署三艘该型潜艇。 <br><br>

美方的报告还指出，中国正在研发两款新型核潜艇DD095型巡航导弹攻击核潜艇(SSGN)和096型战略核潜艇。其中096型具备更远的(潜射弹道导弹)射程，更低的噪音，更加强大的威慑力。 <br><br>

报告还认为，美军在关岛的军事设施，现在已经被中国的巡航导弹射程所覆盖。考虑到中国的海基对陆攻击能力不足。未来，中国海军的095型巡航导弹核潜艇和旅洋-3型(052D型)驱逐舰，很可能会搭载陆攻巡航导弹，提升中国海军在西太平洋的对陆打击能力，目标包含美国在关岛的设施。 <br><br>

今年6月，中国空军接收了15架轰-6K轰炸机。轰-6K是轰-6的最新改进型，除了航程提升外，还可以搭载中国最新的远程对地巡航导弹。新轰炸机和远程巡航导弹，同样也给了中国空军对西太平洋目标发起突袭的能力，目标同样包含关岛。<br><br> 

在美方的报告中还给给出了东风-21D反舰弹道导弹的射程DD1500公里。这足以威胁美军在西太平洋的舰艇。不过还不能打到距离中国3000公里外的关岛。 <br><br>

该报告还提到了中国海军的航母项目，认为中国海军辽宁号航母会继续进行训练任务，直到2015-2016年期间，中国第一个歼-15团正式具备作战能力。 <br><br>

在中国海军还在大力发展水面舰艇。2012年期间，中国海军完成了旅洋-3级(052D)驱逐舰和江岛级(056型)护卫舰这两款新型舰艇。同时，旅洋-2级(052C型)和江凯-2级(054A)型也在持续建造中。这一批次的舰艇大部分将在2015年具备作战能力。 <br><br>

到2015年，就数量而言，自冷战结束以来，中国将很可能在大型战舰建造和服役方面跻身世界第二。到2020年，除非美国海军“复兴”，在年产潜艇、水面战舰和其他军舰方面，中国或将成为世界首屈一指的国家。最后，报告认为，中国军事现代化，是在改变未来亚洲5-10年的军力平衡，挑战美国军事力量。” <br><br>

美媒曝东风21D能覆盖西太美军但还打不到关岛<br><br>
美称中国巨浪-2导弹初具核威慑美国本土战力 <br><br>
2013-11-12   环球网<br><br>




2013年11月12日   光明网 <br><br>
据美国《战略之页》网站7月24日刊文称，中国的巨浪-2和俄罗斯的布拉瓦虽均已经宣布准备成军，但由于仍存在诸多问题，实际上并未开始服役。拖延滞后也是中俄军事技术发展中的常见现象。<br><br>

　　这两款海基导弹在研制过程中均遇到了难以克服的问题。布拉瓦曾因为试射一直失败，几乎要被取消，但最终于2011年12月23日成功完成了测试项目。在18此试射中，成功了11此，试射成功率仅为61%。而且该导弹仍然存在需要解决的问题，还需要进行更多的试射。2012年初，俄罗斯宣布年内将恢复远程战斗巡逻。按照计划，俄罗斯海军去年12月30日最终接收了首艘北风之神级战略核潜艇“尤里・多尔戈鲁基”号。一旦装备可用战略核导弹，这艘新潜艇可能会成为俄罗斯多年来首艘执行远程巡航任务的战略核潜艇。<br><br>

　　中国的巨浪-2潜射导弹本来应该在五年前开始服役，但直到现在仍未成军。该型导弹存在诸多问题，而要装备它的核潜艇也是如此。巨浪-2重42吨，射程7000公里，如果094潜艇携带该型导弹巡航到夏威夷或阿拉斯加，将可对美国境内的任意目标进行打击。每艘094核潜艇可携带12枚巨浪-2战略导弹。目前为止，中国的核潜艇从未进行过战斗巡航，因为它们的性能并不可靠。094核潜艇最近似乎进行了海试，但并并不清楚是否成功。<br><br>

　　美媒最后称，相比之下，美国的海基战略导弹研发就要成功的多。(编译：艾国)<br><br>

China’s Naval Modernization

Implications for the United States<br><br>

Executive Summary<br><br>
In the late 1980s, China began a modernization program to transform the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy from a coastal force into a technologically-advanced regional navy. China’s acquisition of platforms, weapons, and systems has emphasized qualitative improvements, not quantitative growth, and centered on improving its ability to strike opposing ships at sea and operate at greater distances from the Chinese mainland. The PLA Navy has made significant progress, particularly since the late 1990s. Today, it is able to conduct high intensity operations in China’s immediate periphery and carry out low intensity operations around the world. Trends in China’s defense spending, research and development, and shipbuilding suggest the PLA Navy will continue to modernize through at least 2020. China’s increasingly advanced and adaptive naval capabilities C many of which appear to be designed to restrict U.S. freedom of action throughout the Western Pacific C could undermine U.S. interests and security in the region.<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T4">Drivers of China’s Naval Modernization</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
For over 30 years following the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) establishment in 1949, the PLA Navy was a coastal force comprised of large numbers of low capability platforms. Its primary mission was supporting the army’s efforts to deter and, if necessary, defend against a foreign amphibious invasion. However, China’s interests expanded beyond the country’s territorial boundaries in the late 1970s and early 1980 as China’s economy grew and threat perceptions evolved. This incentivized Beijing to pay more attention to the maritime domain and to build a modern navy capable of playing a larger role in China’s national security.1<br><br>
Events of the 1990s C including the success of U.S. long-range, precision strikes in Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and the U.S. deployment of two aircraft carrier battle groups during the Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1995-96 C demonstrated to Beijing that the United States might be willing to intervene in a regional conflict involving China and could do so effectively. This led Beijing to accelerate its naval modernization and to focus on developing capabilities to counter foreign intervention in Chinese affairs, particularly U.S. naval and air operations in a Taiwan contingency.2<br><br>
In 2004, Beijing issued a directive to the PLA to prepare for nontraditional missions beyond China’s immediate periphery, including international peacekeeping operations, humanitarian assistance, and counterterrorism. In Beijing’s view, these missions are essential to China’s development because they help extend China’s global influence, portray China as a responsible player on the world stage, and support international stability. Linking China’s economic and strategic interests abroad to the PLA created a requirement for the PLA Navy to be able to project power on a limited basis.3<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T5">China’s Naval Strategy</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
China’s naval modernization is guided by an overarching strategy, which Chinese documents refer to as Offshore Defense (jinhai fangyu). Offshore Defense is a flexible concept that the PLA Navy updates as necessary to incorporate its growing capabilities and force restructuring, lessons learned from exercises and training, and the most recent high-level guidance and threat assessments. Offshore Defense seeks to achieve the following strategic objectives:<br><br>



  Deter and defend China against foreign military intervention in Chinese affairs, such as peacetime foreign military operations near China that Beijing judges threaten its interests and foreign amphibious invasions, blockades, and strikes against the Chinese mainland.<br><br>
  Deter and reverse any moves by Taiwan toward de jure independence.<br><br>
  Develop a sea-based nuclear force to support Beijing’s nuclear deterrence strategy.*<br><br>
  Deter and defend against threats to China’s maritime trade routes.<br><br>
  Deter and defend against challenges to China’s maritime territory, sovereignty, and resources.<br><br>
  Protect China’s interests abroad.4<br><br>


During peacetime, Offshore Defense emphasizes gaining control of China’s near seas  and steadily expanding China’s maritime perimeter out to the Second Island Chain.<br><br>

During wartime, the strategy calls for engaging opposing naval forces as far from the Chinese coast as possible and, if necessary, overwhelming those forces as they approach China. The most important wartime task is to prevent foreign military forces from interfering with China’s wartime objectives.5 The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) characterizes these operations as “anti-access/area denial.” China, however, uses the term “counterintervention,” reflecting its perception that such operations are reactive.6<br><br>

There are indications Beijing is considering a new naval strategy, often referred to as Distant Sea Defense (yuanhai fangwei),§ to provide a better framework for the PLA Navy to pursue the greater range and complexities of its expanding roles and missions. The major difference between Offshore Defense and Distant Sea Defense is that the latter envisions the PLA Navy conducting longer-range surface and submarine patrols, defense of more distant maritime trade routes, and more regular and robust military missions other than war. Whether or not China continues to adhere to Offshore Defense or adopts a new strategy, most U.S. analysts agree the PLA Navy will continue to focus on China’s near seas and will not soon develop capabilities for persistent global power projection.7<br><br>

The PLA Navy’s expanding role in military missions other than war and new willingness to operate in distant seas creates opportunities to enhance maritime cooperation between the United States and China, which could help to build trust between the two militaries and contribute to stronger bilateral ties. The United States and China already conducted their first and second bilateral counterpiracy exercises in September 2012 and August 2013, respectively. The two countries also agreed to hold a bilateral search and rescue exercise and their first bilateral humanitarian assistance and disaster relief exercise later in 2013. Furthermore, China accepted the U.S. offer to participate in the U.S.-led multilateral Rim of the Pacific exercise in 2014.36<br><br>
However, China’s increasingly advanced and adaptive naval capabilities C many of which appear to be designed to restrict U.S. freedom of action throughout the Western Pacific C could undermine U.S. interests and security in the region. Beijing’s ever improving anti-access/area denial capabilities raise the costs and risks to the United States for intervention in a potential regional conflict involving China and increase the operational and fiscal commitments required by the United States to maintain open and secure access to the maritime commons in the Western Pacific. <br><br>Furthermore, the PLA Navy’s rapidly advancing regional power projection capability likely boosts Beijing’s confidence in its ability to assert its maritime claims in the East China Sea and South China Sea and to respond forcefully to perceived challenges by rival claimants. To protect and advance U.S. interests in Asia, it will be important for the United States to remain deeply engaged in the region and demonstrate that it has the capacity and resolve to actively shape C and offset C China’s growing naval capabilities.<br><br>

REPORT TO CONGRESS
of the
U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC AND
SECURITY REVIEW COMMISSION
ONE HUNDRED THIRTEENTH CONGRESS<br><br>
FIRST SESSION<br><br>
NOVEMBER 2013<br><br>

SECTION 3: CHINA’S MARITIME DISPUTES<br><br>
Introduction<br><br>
This section provides an overview of China’s East China Sea and
South China Sea disputes, covering the drivers of Beijing’s approach
to the disputed waters, the means by which China is asserting
sovereignty in those areas, the risks of escalation or miscalculation
at sea, and the consequential dangers of political or military
escalation. It is based on witness testimonies from Commission
hearings; information from the Commission’s fact-finding trips to
China, Japan, and Taiwan; and additional research. This section
primarily focuses on the East China Sea; the South China Sea was
covered in detail in chapter 3, section 1, of the Commission’s 2012
Annual Report.<br><br>
Maritime Dispute Overview<br><br>
Peter Dutton, professor and director of the China Maritime Studies
Institute at the U.S. Naval War College, testified to the Commission
that China’s overall interests and objectives in the East
and South China Seas include:<br><br>
. . . enhancing China’s sense of national security, acquiring
control over the region’s living and non-living maritime resources,
and restoring China’s place of pre-eminence in the
East Asian regional order . . . Additionally, consolidating
Chinese state power over the offshore islands and regional
seas serves the Communist Party’s interest in maintaining
internal political credibility by delivering to the Chinese
people what they believe is rightfully their own.1<br><br>
Although sovereignty disputes in the East and South China Seas
are not new, China’s growing diplomatic, economic, and military
clout is improving China’s ability to assert its interests. It is increasingly
clear that China does not intend to resolve the disputes
through multilateral negotiations or the application of international
laws and adjudicative processes but instead will use its
growing power in support of coercive tactics that pressure its
neighbors to concede China’s claims.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T8">East China Sea Dispute Background</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

The East China Sea dispute involves China, Japan, and Taiwan
(see figure 1).  The dispute can be divided into two distinct issues:
territorial sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands (known as Diaoyu
Dao in China, and Diaoyutai in Taiwan), and demarcation of maritime
zones, which has implications for natural resource rights.<br><br>

China’s most intense dispute in this area relates to territorial
sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands, eight uninhabited islets that
lie approximately 120 nautical miles (nm) northeast of Taiwan, and
240 nm southwest of Japan’s Okinawa Island. China and Taiwan
rely on a historical foundation as far back as the Ming Dynasty
(1368C1644) to justify their claims to the islands. According to China’s
official narrative, Japan ‘‘secretly ‘included’ Diaoyu Dao in its
territory at the end of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894C1895. Japan
then forced China to sign the unequal Treaty of Shimonoseki,’’
ceding the Senkaku Islands and Taiwan to Japan.2<br><br>
Japan administers the Senkaku Islands and asserts there is no
territorial dispute over the islands. When Japan made an official
declaration incorporating the Senkaku Islands into Japanese territory
in 1895, it considered them uninhabited land without an
owner. The United States administered the islands following the
1951 Treaty of San Francisco officially concluding World War II
until the 1971 Okinawa Reversion Treaty came into force. This
treaty transferred administrative rights over the Senkaku Islands
to Japan while maintaining U.S. neutrality on the ultimate sovereignty
of the islands.3 Japan argues China did not express an interest
in the islands until a 1968 United Nations (UN) study suggested
the possibility of petroleum resources in the East China
Sea.4<br><br>
The Japanese government’s September 2012 purchase of three of
the Senkaku Islands from a private Japanese owner angered
China, sparking an escalation in tensions between China and
Japan.* 5 Beijing immediately responded by issuing a Government
Statement, its highest-level diplomatic document, which for the
first time includes map coordinates to its claims in the East China
Sea.   Later that month, China’s State Council released a white
paper on the Senkakus, its first ever on a territorial dispute, which
stated the ‘‘Diaoyu Dao is China’s inherent territory in all historical,
geographical, and legal terms, and China enjoys indisputable
sovereignty over Diaoyu Dao.’’ 6<br><br>
A separate but equally important dispute among China, Japan,
and Taiwan is over rights and interests (including natural resource
extraction) involving maritime demarcation of overlapping exclusive
economic zones (EEZ) within the East China Sea. The dispute―
which primarily concerns the Chunxiao (Shirakaba in Japanese)
Gas Field―is mainly a result of differing interpretations of
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).<br><br>
Among many other provisions, UNCLOS allots nations an EEZ out
to 200 nm from their coastal baselines.   Although a coastal nation


cannot claim full sovereignty in an EEZ, it does have sovereign
rights to explore, exploit, and protect natural resources, including
fisheries, in this zone.7 UNCLOS also provides similar rights over
natural resources, with the exception of fishing, in an extended
continental shelf zone up to 150 nm beyond a country’s EEZ, subject
to certain restrictions based on seafloor geography.8<br><br>
Because the maritime distance between China and Japan in the
East China Sea is less than 400 nm, neither China nor Japan can
claim a full EEZ in this region. Japan proposes a median line between
the two countries as an attempt to divide EEZ rights evenly.<br><br>
China claims an extension of its continental shelf eastward past
the median line to the Okinawa Trough and in December 2012 formalized
its position in a claim submission to the United Nations.9<br><br>

Six parties claim the South China Sea in part or in full: China,
Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei. Beijing
denotes its claim on its South China Sea maps using a nine-dash
line, with an additional dash off the coast of Taiwan to demonstrate
its claim over Taiwan (see figure 2). Also in dispute are
two sets of island groups: the Paracel Islands, located in the northern
part of the sea, and the Spratly Islands, a widespread collection
of approximately 200 islands, islets, rocks, and reefs located in the
southern part of the South China Sea. <br><br>China occupies the Paracel Islands, though Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to them. While
all claimants except Brunei have established military outposts in
the Spratly Islands, China and Vietnam occupy the greatest number
of outposts.* For a comprehensive discussion of the South
China Sea dispute, see chapter 3, section 1, of the Commission’s
2012 Annual Report, ‘‘China and the South China Sea.’’<br><br>

	<b><a name="T10">China’s Overall Approach to Maritime Disputes</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
At the Commission’s hearing on China’s maritime disputes, two
longtime China watchers concluded that China is seeking to change
the status quo in its favor in both the East and South China Seas.<br><br>
Rear Admiral Michael McDevitt, USN (Retd.), senior fellow at CNA
Center for Naval Analysis, said in testimony to the Commission
that China has taken a ‘‘proactive approach toward creating a new,
[more] favorable status quo’’ with regard to its maritime disputes.<br><br>
He assessed Beijing has been more assertive since 2012, offering
rival claimants the choice of either facing the brunt of Chinese
power as a result of challenging Chinese claims or benefitting from
economic and political rewards for moderating their positions or
even acquiescing to China’s claims.10<br><br>
Michael Swaine, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, emphasized in his testimony that Beijing has
in some instances ‘‘responded in a deliberately escalatory manner’’
to perceived attempts by China’s rival claimants to secure territorial
gains in the disputed waters, ‘‘seeking to create a new status
quo in its favor or to undertake a more muscular or aggressive action
in order to convey resolve and deter further escalation by others.’’<br><br>
11 For example, Beijing appears to have calculated that Japan’s
purchase of the Senkaku Islands provided a justification to
deploy a regular maritime presence supporting a new status quo in
China’s favor.12<br><br>
Chinese official statements and use of maritime law enforcement
rather than military forces suggest Beijing prefers to avoid direct
military conflict over its maritime disputes and rely on the shift in
the balance of regional power in its favor to resolve its maritime
disputes in the long term.13 China probably judges that as a result
of its growing power and influence vis-a`-vis other claimants to the
East and South China Seas, time is on its side with regard to consolidating
control over its maritime claims.<br><br>

Nationalism<br><br>
The new Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership has affirmed
that it intends to continue governing China without resort
to elections or other democratic processes, and the CCP has long
been aware that the absence of democratic legitimacy tends to undermine
the stability of its rule. As a result, the CCP places a high
priority on legitimizing itself by convincing the Chinese people that
it is delivering economic growth, a better quality of life, and an assertion
of China’s ascendance regionally and globally.<br><br>
In fact, Beijing has long used the education system and media
to cultivate an awareness of China’s victimization during what
China calls its century of humiliation from the mid-19th to the
mid-20th centuries.14 By promoting a sense of grievance among the
Chinese people, and then aggressively asserting China’s claims
against its neighbors, the CCP shifts attention away from the authoritarian
nature of its rule and toward its role as the champion
of China’s interests in the region.<br><br>
China not only takes an aggressive stance in the region to satisfy
the nationalistic impulse it has promoted; it also uses nationalism


domestically to support its regional claims. Jessica Chen Weiss, assistant
professor of political science at Yale University, testified to
the Commission: ‘‘The Chinese government has allowed nationalist
street demonstrations when it wants to demonstrate resolve to signal
that China will not budge on [an] issue. Just as the [U.S.]
president can point to Congress and say his hands are tied, so can
the Chinese leadership point to nationalist fervor and say that they
can’t compromise or else protestors will turn against them.’’ 15<br><br>
For example, Beijing permitted large-scale, anti-Japanese demonstrations
in the fall of 2012 following the Japanese government’s
purchase of several of the Senkaku Islands. Demonstrations in China’s
second- and third- tier cities even became destructive, damaging
storefronts of Japanese companies, such as Toyota and
Panasonic.16<br><br>
On the other hand, the Chinese government suppresses popular
nationalism if it believes doing so will help it achieve its diplomatic
objectives.17 For example, in a move attributed to Beijing, the Hong
Kong government in August 2013 prevented a group of anti-Japan
activists from sailing to the Senkaku Islands as they did in 2012
to mark the anniversary of Japan’s World War II surrender.18 Beijing
likely judged popular Chinese animosity toward Japan threatened
a potentially volatile public backlash that it might not be able
to manage or exploit to its advantage. However, as Dr. Weiss testified,
suppressing nationalist sentiment is ‘‘costly for the Chinese
government, which has often been accused [by its people] of being
both unpatriotic and undemocratic in suppressing nationalist sentiment.’’
19<br><br>
Sovereignty and ‘‘Core Interests’’<br><br>
China’s view of ‘‘indisputable sovereignty’’ over its maritime
claims underlies its overall policy approach to the East and South
China Seas.20 As tensions involving China’s maritime disputes in
the East China Sea and South China Sea have grown since 2009,
official and unofficial Chinese sources indicate China views the
East and South China Seas as central to its ‘‘core interests,’’ which
authoritative Chinese speeches and documents define as (1) national
security; (2) sovereignty and territorial integrity; and (3) economic
and social sustained development.21 Beijing makes core interest
declarations to signal to other countries that China is unwilling
to compromise on particular policy issues and to imply that
China would use force to defend its core interests. These declarations
usually relate to matters regarding China’s territorial sovereignty,
such as Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang.22<br><br>
China appears to have overtly linked the South China Sea and
East China Sea to China’s core interests in recent years.* 23 Japanese
commentators expressed concern that the designation of the
Senkaku Islands as a core interest in April signaled a shift in Beijing’s approach to the maritime dispute and indicated China ‘‘will
make no concessions on the islets.’’ 24 Subsequent official Chinese
statements have not clarified the status of the islands, allowing
Beijing to maintain flexibility in its approach to the dispute, prevent
any domestic accusations that China is adopting a weaker
stance, and deny that it is taking unilateral actions or escalating
tensions.25<br><br>
Economic Development<br><br>
China also views the East and South China Seas as central to
its economic development, due to their resource potential and significant
roles as maritime transit routes. Though nationalism has
a stronger pull on China’s foreign policy-making levers with regard
to its maritime disputes, natural resources are significant because
they galvanize popular nationalist sentiment.26<br><br>
Oil and Gas Resources: China’s surging economy has made the
country increasingly dependent on oil and gas to supply its growing
industrial and manufacturing base. However, hydrocarbon reserves
in the East and South China Seas would provide only modest relief
to the heavy energy demands of many of the surrounding Asian
economies, according to Lloyd Thrall, project associate at the
RAND Corporation.27 Additionally, the financial feasibility of exploiting
oil and gas reserves in these areas is limited at best. In
the South China Sea, the risk and cost of recovering deepwater oil
and gas in contested waters prone to unusually strong currents and
tropical storms heavily outweighs the minimal benefit of yet-to-beproven
hydrocarbons.28 Nevertheless, the speculation and perceived
economic value of natural resources in both seas fuels the narrative
of competition and sovereignty by the respective claimants.29<br><br>
Maritime Trade Routes: The East and South China Seas play
central roles in the transport of oil and gas to China’s coastal regions,
which serve as the engines of China’s economic growth.30 According
to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, almost a
third of the world’s crude oil passes through the South China Sea,
with about 15 percent of this volume moving on to Northeast Asia
and the East China Sea.31 Additionally, over half of the world’s
traded liquefied natural gas (LNG) passes through the South China
Sea. China’s reliance on this trade route is projected to grow significantly
in the coming two decades due to increasing LNG consumption.<br><br>
As Steven Lewis, fellow and professor at Rice University,
testified to the Commission: ‘‘The future economic growth of China’s
most prosperous cities and provinces is one heavily tied to
massive fleets of LNG carriers (with four or five times the number
of vessels used today)’’ transiting the East and South China Seas.32<br><br>
Fisheries: According to Mr. Thrall, ‘‘Fishermen in East and
Southeast Asia are potent national symbols . . . to have fishermen
denied their livelihood in areas perceived as historical fishing
grounds, or, worse yet, detained or facing violence can strike deeply
discordant notes’’ within China. 33 This dynamic helps explain the
nationalist sentiment in China that followed the detention of the
captain of a Chinese fishing trawler upon his collision with a Japanese
Coast Guard (JCG) vessel in September 2010. Similar sentiments are prevalent across the region; the death of a Taiwan fisherman<br><br>
in May 2013, a result of the Philippine Coast Guard firing
shots at a Taiwan fishing boat in disputed fishing grounds, set off
nationalist outpourings across Taiwan. The incident led to three
months of strained relations between Taiwan and the Philippines
that ended only after Manila offered an official apology, agreed to
pay compensation to the victim’s family, and recommended homicide
charges for the Philippine Coast Guard personnel who opened
fire on the Taiwan fishing boat.34 See chapter 3, section 2, of this
Report, ‘‘Taiwan,’’ for full coverage of the Taiwan-Philippine row.<br><br>
Advancing Maritime Claims in Regional and Multilateral Organizations<br><br>
The multilateral nature of the South China Sea dispute, as opposed
to the generally bilateral nature of the East China Sea dispute,
diffuses negotiating power among multiple claimants, giving
China relatively less influence in the multilateral dispute resolution
process. China as a result seeks to ‘‘divide and conquer’’ by negotiating
the issue on a bilateral basis rather than under the auspices
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). At
the ASEAN Regional Forum Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in July
2013, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi underscored this approach:<br><br>
‘‘The South China Sea issue is not an issue between China
and ASEAN. It is only an issue between China and a small number
of Southeast Asian countries.’’ 35 In 2013, there have been two significant
efforts in multilateral venues seeking to resolve South
China Sea disputes; China has stalled progress in one and refused
to participate in the other.<br><br>
South China Sea Code of Conduct negotiations: Chinese obstructionism
and efforts to exploit disunity among Southeast Asian nations
was a factor in stalled progress toward a binding Code of
Conduct in the South China Sea. China and ASEAN in 2002 signed
a Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea
that laid the groundwork for an eventual Code of Conduct. However,
despite agreeing to ‘‘work, on the basis of consensus, towards
the eventual attainment’’ of a ‘‘code of conduct in the South China
Sea [that] would further promote peace and stability in the region,’’
Beijing remains circumspect on ASEAN calls for formal, substantive
Code of Conduct talks.* 36 During an August 2013 multicountry
visit to Southeast Asia, Foreign Minister Wang emphasized
patience in what he described would be a long-term process toward
concluding a Code of Conduct.37<br><br>
Philippines-initiated arbitration over South China Sea claims:
Manila surprised many observers in January 2013 when it initiated
UNCLOS-based arbitration challenging China’s nine-dash line
and maritime claims in the South China Sea. Beijing has rejected
the arbitral process as ‘‘manifestly unfounded’’ under UNCLOS and
declined to participate.38 In an official Foreign Ministry statement
responding to the arbitration, Beijing denounced the Philippines’ the arbitral process counteracts ongoing bilateral negotiations that
would peacefully resolve the South China Sea issue.39 However,
China’s refusal to participate in the arbitration has not prevented
the formation of an arbitral tribunal or delayed the proceedings. A
five-judge tribunal in the Hague is expected to consider Manila’s
arguments following their submission in March 2014 and is likely
to conclude proceedings by mid-2015.* 40<br><br>
Political tension is particularly pronounced between China and
the Philippines due to China’s view that the Philippines has internationalized
the South China Sea disputes.41 In August 2013, official
Chinese press signaled displeasure with the Philippines, seemingly
for instituting arbitration to draw international attention to
the lack of progress on a Code of Conduct: ‘‘. . . certain countries are
deliberately creating an issue of the ‘Code of Conduct’ and are not
genuinely concerned about the ‘Code’ but instead want to use this
kind of hyping to multilateralize and internationalize South China
Sea issues.’’ 42

	<b><a name="T12">Legal and Administrative Assertions of Maritime Sovereignty</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Since late 2012, China has stepped up its use of a number of
legal and administrative methods to assert sovereignty over its
claims in the East and South China Seas, including the following:<br><br>
   After the Japanese Senkaku purchase in September 2012, Beijing
published its claim to the disputed islands in an official
Government Statement ‘‘on the Baselines of the Territorial Sea
of Diaoyu Dao and Its Affiliated Islands’’ and submitted these
claims to the UN.43 Japan, which does not officially recognize
a dispute over the islands, countered with its position that China’s
submission was ‘‘totally unacceptable and legally invalid.’’
44 The United States also has protested China’s claims,
calling them ‘‘improperly drawn.’’ 45<br><br>
   In 2012, China introduced a new passport design that has a
watermark of a national map that includes popular tourist
sites in Taiwan, its nine-dash line around the South China
Sea, and border areas disputed with India as part of its territory.<br><br>
Countries disputing the depiction of China’s territory denounced
China’s new passports, and some are not stamping
the new passports and instead are issuing separate visa
sheets.46<br><br>
   Hainan Province, China’s southernmost province, issued new
maritime regulations in late 2012. The regulations, which are applicable to the 12 nm territorial waters within Hainan Province’s
announced baselines, include a provision allowing China
to board, inspect, and expel foreign vessels ‘‘illegally’’ entering
Chinese waters.47 According to Wu Shicun, director of the Hainan
Foreign Affairs Office and president of China’s National
Institute for South China Sea Studies, the provision is designed
to curb Vietnamese fishing activity near the Paracel Islands.
48<br><br>
   China’s official Sinomaps Press issued a new national map in
January 2013 that includes China’s South China Sea claims.<br><br>
The new map depicts the entire South China Sea on the same
scale as mainland China, rather than using insets to illustrate
China’s claimed island groups. The map also includes a dash
southeast of Taiwan delineating China’s claim over Taiwan,
bringing China’s well-known nine-dash line claim in the South
China Sea to ten dashes. Although official Chinese maps have
included the tenth dash for at least the past two years, its
larger-scale incorporation into the newest version of an official
Chinese map raised concerns among China’s neighbors in both
the East and South China Seas.49 One Sinomaps editor said
the changes in presentation served to ‘‘elevate the [Chinese]
peoples’ consciousness of national territory and safeguard China’s
maritime rights and interests.’’ 50<br><br>
Maritime Law Enforcement Assertions of Maritime Sovereignty
China’s maritime law enforcement agencies since 2009 have
played an increasing role as the frontline actors in staking and enforcing
China’s maritime claims.51 Beijing likely sees this approach
as less provocative than the use of the PLA Navy and a means to
demonstrate de facto governance over its territorial claims. Nevertheless,
robust and near-constant deployments of increasingly capable
maritime law enforcement vessels, with the PLA Navy often deployed
nearby, effectively serve as coercive policy instruments in
the East and South China Seas.52<br><br>
Since 2012, China has begun to ‘‘[respond] to challenges to its
claims with an enhanced physical presence to bolster China’s position
and deter any further challenges,’’ according to M. Taylor
Fravel, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. ‘‘These responses suggest an even greater
willingness to pursue unilateral actions to advance its claims.’’ Dr.
Fravel further notes that this activity is a recent departure from
what had for several decades been a pattern of Chinese restraint
with regard to the presence of ships and aircraft in disputed waters.<br><br>
53 Several other analysts have observed this change in China’s
approach to island disputes since the 2012 Scarborough Reef standoff,
which began with a confrontation between China and the Philippines
over the fishing activities of several Chinese fishing vessels
at the reef, located in the South China Sea.* 54 Both countries had
previously fished in Scarborough Reef despite disputing its territoriality. Over the course of the months-long standoff, China established physical control over the reef by patrolling the vicinity
with maritime law enforcement vessels and roping off the reef’s entrance
to prevent Philippine vessels from operating there.55 At the
time of this Report’s publication, China continues to maintain de
facto control over the reef.56<br><br>
China has applied similar tactics in Second Thomas Shoal, a
coral reef in the South China Sea approximately 105 nm west of
Palawan Island, Philippines. The Philippines in early May 2013 reported
a PLA Navy vessel escorting two Chinese maritime law enforcement
ships and approximately 30 fishing boats in the shoal.<br><br>
The Philippines maintains a regular presence on Second Thomas
Shoal of approximately 12 marines aboard the BRP Sierra Madre,
a World War II-era U.S. tank landing ship that the Philippine
Navy deliberately ran aground on the shoal in 1999 to stake its territorial
claim.57 China frames this ‘‘illegal occupation’’ of Chinese
territory as justification for its enhanced patrols in the waters surrounding
Second Thomas Shoal.58<br><br>
The Commission learned in meetings with the JCG that PLA
Navy and Chinese maritime law enforcement activity near the
Senkaku Islands, previously irregular and sporadic, increased
sharply following Japan’s Senkaku Islands purchase. Official Chinese
press appears to confirm the purchase marked a turning point
for China’s maritime operations, after which Chinese government
ships maintained a near-persistent presence near the disputed
isles. (See figure 3 for a depiction of this operational state based
on JCG data.)59<br><br>

	<b><a name="T13">Japan Reconsiders Self-Defense in the East China Sea</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
The ongoing domestic debate over whether Tokyo should revise
its constitution to expand the circumstances for self-defense was
a prominent theme of the Commission’s fact-finding trip to
Japan this year. Japan remains divided on the issue of revising
a constitutional provision renouncing war and preventing the
maintenance of a military force.60 In meetings with a group of
retired Japan Self-Defense Force and JCG senior officers, the
Commission learned that such a revision could, for example,
allow the Japan Self-Defense Force to employ arms in the event
of intrusion into Japan’s territorial waters by foreign government
vessels. The retired senior officers further explained that under
the current constitution, a lengthy legal process would precede any decision by Tokyo to exercise self-defense. This would complicate
Tokyo’s ability to authorize a military response to a perceived
Chinese escalation in the East China Sea, especially if
such activity involves only Chinese maritime law enforcement―
not naval―vessels.<br><br>

Beijing has undertaken a number of steps since mid-2012 to address
several shortcomings in its coordination of maritime policy to
better align China’s maritime activity with national policy. China’s
lack of a unified maritime strategy and multiple―sometimes overlapping―
bureaucracies has previously been characterized as a
model of inefficiency and an impediment to effective policymaking.<br><br>
61
In mid-2012, China created a new, high-level advisory group for
maritime security issues. In China’s foreign policy-making apparatus,
key Chinese security policy issues, such as Taiwan, foreign
affairs, and national security traditionally have merited their own
high-level advisory groups within the Politburo Standing Committee.<br><br>
62 However, this is the first time maritime security has been
elevated to this level, signaling the rising importance of this issue
to Chinese leadership. The designation of Xi Jinping, who at the
time was the top contender to be China’s next senior leader, as the
group’s head, also indicates high-level attention to the matter. Furthermore,
upon Japan’s 2012 purchase of the Senkaku Islands, Beijing
reportedly formed an ‘‘Office to Respond to the Diaoyu Crisis’’
and again placed Mr. Xi at the helm.63<br><br>
China previously had six chief maritime law enforcement agencies,
all with separate and sometimes overlapping missions. In
June 2013, China officially consolidated four of these six agencies―
China Marine Surveillance, China Coast Guard, Fisheries Law Enforcement
Command, and Maritime Customs Service―into the new
China Coast Guard. The Maritime Safety Administration and
China Rescue and Salvage remain independent.64 The inaugural
China Coast Guard patrol occurred near the Senkaku Islands, and
was intended to ‘‘sternly declare the Chinese government’s stance
on its sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands to Japanese vessels,’’ according
to an official Chinese statement.65<br><br>
While most of these ships previously had been unarmed, those
subordinated to the China Coast Guard under the new structure
could now be armed with mounted guns.66 Furthermore, the China
Coast Guard’s capabilities will continue to modernize and improve
in the next three to five years as it receives at least 30 new oceangoing
ships and more than 100 smaller patrol boats. Most of these
vessels will be larger and more capable than previous ones, and
some will have the ability to embark helicopters. China’s maritime
law enforcement agencies also will continue to incorporate decommissioned
ships from the PLA Navy into their own fleets―a practice
that has increased in recent years.67<br><br>


Military Assertions of Maritime Sovereignty<br><br>
The PLA Navy plays a powerful but indirect role in the East and
South China Seas, backing up maritime law enforcement patrols
from a distance; training, transiting, and conducting highly visible
displays of presence in disputed waters; and resupplying Chinesecontrolled
islands in the South China Sea.* 68<br><br>
   In March 2013, the PLA Navy sent a task force comprised of
one large amphibious ship and three modern surface combatants
to James Shoal, which is the southernmost point of China’s
maritime claim in the South China Sea and lies approximately
43 nm off the coast of Malaysia. According to official
Chinese media, the crews of these vessels held a ceremony
pledging to safeguard China’s maritime interests upon reaching
James Shoal. The task force then conducted training in the
West Pacific before returning home.69<br><br>
   In May 2013, the PLA Navy conducted a rare, multifleet exercise
involving elements of all three PLA Navy fleets in the
South China Sea. While China’s Ministry of National Defense
described the exercise as ‘‘routine’’ and ‘‘not aimed at any specific
country or target,’’ 70 some commentators suggested the
exercise was used for political signaling during the China-Philippines
standoff at Second Thomas Shoal and the transit of the
U.S. Navy’s USS Nimitz aircraft carrier through the region.71<br><br>
   

   In mid-July 2013, following a joint exercise with the Russian
Navy, a PLA Navy task force for the first time passed through
the La Perouse Strait (also known as the Soya Strait), dividing
northern Japan and Russia. The group of five vessels then
transited east of Japan through the Pacific Ocean and back
around southern Japan through the Miyako Strait dividing Japan’s
Miyako and Okinawa Islands, before reaching its homeport
in Qingdao.72 Japanese press portrayed the route as ‘‘intended
to demonstrate Chinese naval might to Japan and the
United States and show Russia it means business in the region.’’
73 Official Chinese press heralded the event as a demonstration
of the PLA Navy’s ability to gain access to the Pacific
Ocean through narrow chokepoints and to ‘‘cut the first island
chain into several pieces,’’ according to a PLA Navy official.
74 Chinese strategists and academics assert that the
United States and Japan use the first island chain to strategically
encircle or contain China and to prevent China from operating
freely in the Pacific.   75<br><br>
The PLA Navy’s regional power projection capability has advanced
rapidly since the 1990s, boosting Beijing’s ability to assert
its maritime claims in the East and South China Seas and to respond
forcefully to perceived challenges by rival claimants. See
chapter 2, section 1, of this Report, ‘‘Military and Security Year in
Review,’’ for full coverage of China’s naval modernization.76<br><br>

	<br>
	<b><a name="T14">Risk of Unintended Escalation in the East and South China Seas</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
While Beijing’s efforts to streamline its decision making on maritime
disputes may reduce the risk of unintended escalation or accidents
stemming from poor policy coordination, this risk is unlikely
to be completely eliminated for the following reasons.
First, China’s crisis management approach emphasizes demonstrating
resolve to assert its sovereignty claims to rival claimants
and domestic audiences. This characteristic, combined with
China’s tendency to view sovereignty in moralistic and absolutist
terms, results in China’s greater capacity to engage in escalatory
actions in a foreign policy crisis.77<br><br>
Second, despite Beijing’s efforts to consolidate its maritime bureaucracy,
the fragmented nature of China’s foreign policy structure
could undermine Beijing’s cohesiveness on maritime issues,
particularly in the East China Sea. A major contributing factor is
the limited authority of the Chinese Foreign Ministry. The Chinese
Foreign Minister ranks several steps below the Politburo, whereas
his Japanese counterpart occupies a much more influential position
within the Japanese government. In some cases, this difference in
protocol ranking between the two foreign ministries has prevented
meaningful dialogue from taking place at the working level and
could limit the capacity for crisis mitigation. For example, despite
its limited authority, the Chinese Foreign Ministry was reportedly
the only official channel open to Tokyo during the 2012 Senkaku
Island crisis. Frequent turnover in Japanese leadership from 2006
to 2012 has further hindered the establishment of consistent official
and unofficial diplomatic channels between the two countries.78<br><br>

Finally, deficiencies in civil-military coordination could continue
to hamper policy coordination in the East and South China Seas.
Officials at Japan’s National Institute for Defense Studies, a policy
think tank under the Japanese Ministry of Defense, told the Commission
that coordination between the PLA and the Foreign Ministry,
an important nexus in the management of China’s maritime
disputes, remains weak.81 The position of the PLA in the party bureaucracy
outweighs and outranks the Foreign Ministry, which is
one of many ministries under the State Council. <br><br>Therefore, ‘‘for the
Foreign Ministry to liaise with the PLA, it must report up to the
State Council, which may have to report up further up to the Politburo
in order to secure PLA cooperation,’’ according to the Congressional
Research Service.82 Such a structure does not lend itself to
rapid or coordinated decision-making between the PLA and Foreign
Ministry, which would be critical in a crisis in either the East or
South China Seas.<br><br>
The apparent maturation since the mid-2000s of China’s National
Committee on Border and Coastal Defense, an entity under
the ‘‘dual leadership’’ of the State Council and the Central Military
Commission that ‘‘coordinates China’s border and coastal defense,’’
suggests an effort to strengthen civil-military coordination with regard
to border defense. However, outsiders know little about the influence
of this organization on Beijing’s overall management of the
East and South China Sea disputes.83<br><br>
China’s civil-military relationship also poses risks for crisis in
the East and South China Seas at the operational level. Because
the PLA routinely enjoys autonomy for military affairs, operational
military activities that could significantly impact foreign affairs
may not be approved at the highest levels before their execution.84<br><br>
For instance, on two occasions in late January 2013, a Chinese
PLA Navy frigate reportedly locked weapons-targeting radar onto
a Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force platform―first a helicopter,
and later a destroyer. Public information on both Japanese and
Chinese rules of engagement for ships and aircraft in the area is
limited; however, illuminating another military asset with radar
suggests hostile intent under international norms and increases
the risk of miscalculation in an operational environment.85<br><br>
When queried about the incidents at a press conference, China’s
foreign ministry spokesperson stated the foreign ministry was ‘‘not
aware of the matter’’ and knew of the incidents only through press
reports.86 Later in March, Japan’s Kyodo News, citing unnamed
high-level PLA officers, reported that the PLA admitted its frigates
had locked its weapons-targeting radar onto the Japanese platforms.<br><br>
According to Kyodo, these PLA officers claimed the event, at
least in the case of the destroyer, was reportedly due to an isolated
‘‘emergency decision’’ of the frigate’s commander based on the Chinese
military’s rules of engagement.87 China’s Ministry of Defense
dismissed the Kyodo report.88 Nevertheless, the disconnect among
Chinese entities in these cases suggests, as Rear Admiral McDevitt
testified to the Commission, ‘‘that perhaps [the] ability [of Chinese
leadership] to control the situation was not absolute.’’ 89
Such close encounters are not limited to naval surface vessels.<br><br>
Japan also has reported an increasing number of Chinese aircraft
within Japan’s Air Defense Identification Zone. Between March 2012 and March 2013, the Japan Air Self-Defense Force scrambled
fighter jets against Chinese aircraft in 306 instances―the largest
number on record, and the first time this number surpassed the
number of similar Japanese responses against Russia.90 Furthermore,
the Japanese Ministry of Defense in May 2013 reported
three separate instances of PLA Navy submarine operations within
Japan’s contiguous zone in the East China Sea, an UNCLOS-defined
band of water that stretches from 12 to 24 nm from Japan’s
coastal baselines.91 ‘‘Innocent passage’’ of submarines is lawful in
contiguous zones and even in territorial waters, but the frequency
and persistence of such operations at a time of ongoing tension was
enough for Tokyo to raise the issue publically as a means to urge
restraint.92<br><br>
These incidents, particularly the radar lock incident, ‘‘raise questions
about . . . whether there’s an appreciation [in China] for the
degree to which [these were] escalatory act[s],’’ as Roy
Kamphausen, senior advisor for political and security affairs at the
National Bureau for Asian Research, testified to the Commission.93
As interactions between Chinese forces and U.S. and Japanese
forces become more regular, the adherence of international protocols
at sea will become increasingly important for the safety of all
air and maritime operations in the region as well as the stability
of the security situation in the East and South China Seas.<br><br>

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in PRC Foreign<br><br>
Policymaking<br><br>
Although China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs technically is responsible
for the formulation and implementation of China’s foreign
policy, its influence has waned over the past decade. Due to
China’s increased political, economic, and military interaction
with the world in recent decades, a wide array of actors has entered
the Chinese foreign policymaking process through their direct
dealings with foreign entities, including several national ministries,
most provincial governments, the PLA, and state-owned
firms.79 As a result, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is but one of
several Chinese foreign policy actors that often have competing
interests and goals. The exclusion of the foreign minister from
China’s 25-member Politburo since 1998 has further weakened
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ position in the foreign policymaking
process. Though the opacity of the Chinese political system
makes it difficult to render a definitive assessment, most analysts
judge the Politburo and its seven-member Standing Committee
make most of China’s important foreign policy decisions.80
For more information on the proliferation of official and nonofficial
Chinese foreign policy actors, see chapter 3, section 2, of
the Commission’s 2011 Annual Report, ‘‘Actors in China’s Foreign
Policy.’’<br><br>

	<b><a name="T15">Implications for the United States</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Beijing discourages and seeks to prevent the diplomatic involvement
of the United States in the disputes, which Beijing considers
a series of bilateral issues between China and each claimant. In response
to interview questions on the role of the United States in
the East China Sea, China’s Ambassador to the United States Cui
Tiankai stated, ‘‘The most helpful thing the U.S. could do is to remain
truly neutral, to take no side . . . When the United States
talks to us, they say they’ll take no side, but sometimes, when they
talk to the Japanese or when they make public statements, we
hear something different.’’ 94<br><br>
Although the United States does not take a position on the sovereignty
of the disputed features and waters in the East and South
China Seas, its treaty commitments bind it to the region in ways
that link its security interests to the peaceful resolution of China’s
maritime disputes.<br><br>
In the East China Sea, the 1960 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation
and Security between Japan and the United States of America provides
for a U.S. commitment ‘‘in accordance with its constitutional
provisions and processes’’ to defend Japan in the event of an armed
attack ‘‘against either Party in the territories under the administration
of Japan.’’ 95 The official U.S. position includes the Senkaku
Islands, which are under Japanese administration, in its treaty obligations.<br><br>
96 In the South China Sea, the United States maintains
a treaty alliance with the Philippines based on the 1951 Mutual
Defense Treaty between the United States and the Republic of the
Philippines. Though the United States has affirmed its commitment
to the Mutual Defense Treaty,97 it has not officially articulated
the specific geographic areas that would trigger a mutual defense response to the Philippines. Some observers suggest this ambiguity
regarding the Philippines’ disputed land features has led
Manila to misinterpret U.S. defense obligations, perhaps even
emboldening Manila to challenge China.98<br><br>
Forward-deployed U.S. forces in East Asia are another element
of U.S. security policy in the East and South China Seas. As Lt.
Gen. Wallace ‘‘Chip’’ Gregson, USMC (Retd.), currently senior director
for China and the Pacific at the Center for the National Interest,
testified to the Commission, ‘‘Broad, active, widely distributed
presence throughout the theater dampens sources of instability,
deters conflict, gives substance to U.S. security commitments,
and ensures continuing American access to the region.’’ 99<br><br>
As defense budgets tighten, the United States will face difficult
choices in implementing its policy ‘‘rebalance’’ to Asia. A major
challenge ahead for Washington, therefore, will be to stand firm on
its security commitments while resourcing its overall foreign policy
and security goals in the Asia Pacific region.100 An integral part of
this effort is evident in the deepening U.S. diplomatic and military
engagement in the region, with an apparent emphasis on treaty alliances
with the Philippines and Japan.101<br><br>
Finally, the U.S.-China relationship is central to Washington’s
interest in the East and South China Sea disputes. Despite a generally
improving military-to-military relationship, mutual mistrust
about one another’s long-term intentions continues to pervade the
overall security relationship.102 This strategic backdrop poses challenges
for the operational environment at sea, especially as the
maritime operating areas of the two countries increasingly overlap.<br><br>
China’s growing naval and maritime law enforcement advantage
over its neighbors will add to already high levels of confidence that
China can and should take bolder actions to protect its maritime
interests. As U.S.-China air and naval interactions become more
frequent, China’s adherence to and participation in multilateral regimes
regulating mariner interactions, such as the Convention on
the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea and
the Western Pacific Naval Symposium’s Code of Unalerted Encounters
at Sea, will become increasingly critical.103<br><br>
Through its diplomatic actions and the rebalance to Asia, the
United States has signaled its intent to strengthen its relationship
with partners and allies in East Asia. However, China’s military
modernization, coupled with the potential decline in U.S. power
caused by sequestration, is altering the balance of power in the region
and reducing the deterrent effect of the rebalance policy. The
risk is therefore increasing that China’s coercive approach to its
sovereignty claims will lead to greater conflict in the region.<br><br>
Conclusions<br><br>
   China relies on a coercive and persistent maritime law enforcement
and naval presence to gain control of disputed territory in
the East and South China Seas. A consolidated maritime policymaking
bureaucracy and streamlined maritime law enforcement
fleets could increase Beijing’s confidence in its capability for coercion
in the ongoing maritime disputes.<br><br>

   Two key drivers shape China’s approach to its maritime disputes:
First, China encourages ardent popular nationalism, which it exploits
to support its foreign policy aims in the East and South
China Seas. Second, China views sovereignty over claims in the
East and South China Seas as central to its national security,
territorial integrity, and economic development.<br><br>
   China uses legal and administrative measures to assert de jure
governance over its disputed maritime regions; it deploys maritime
law enforcement and naval vessels to its claimed waters to
demonstrate and lay the groundwork for de facto governance.<br><br>
   Beijing’s tendency to demonstrate resolve in its maritime disputes;
its large and complicated political, foreign affairs, and
military bureaucracy; and its inconsistent adherence to internationally
accepted norms of air and maritime operations may
contribute to operational miscalculations in the East and South
China Seas. Unyielding positions on sovereignty and nationalist
sentiment surrounding these maritime disputes increase the risk
of escalation from a miscalculation at sea to a political crisis.<br><br>
