	THE SOLDIER'S FAITH

	<br><br>
美国主流思想就是这样<br><br>

1895年5月30日，霍姆斯应邀以一个三次受伤的内战老兵身份为哈佛大学毕业班做了题为《士兵的信念》（The Soldier‘s Faith）的讲话，霍姆斯自1863年退伍以来所有的伤痛记忆，以及那些记忆带给他的终生不渝的阴郁信念，在这篇讲话中化作了改变他命运的完美修辞：“对我来说，我相信为了生存而斗争是这个世界的秩序，对这个秩序怨愤不平只有徒劳……至少现在，而且可能只要人们还住在这个地球上，他的宿命就是战斗，并且他必须抓住战争的机会……对于士兵来说，不应去想比负伤更多的事情……如果世界被分成无数个五亩地，住在其上的人们衣食无忧，但却没有追求荣誉的神圣愚行，没有无意义的热情去探寻一种其可能性的边界熊熊燃烧因而无法触及的知识，没有他们根本无能企及其意义的理想，那我们谁又能够忍受这样一个世界？我不知道什么是真的，我不知道宇宙的意义，但是在怀疑当中，在教条的土崩瓦解当中，有一个东西我却没有怀疑，并且任何一个和我们当中绝大多数住在同一个世界上的人都不会怀疑，那就是一个士兵的信念。为了一个他几乎不理解的目的，为了一个他完全不明白的战役计划，为了他根本不知道用意的战术，这个信念指引他服从于一个盲目接受的义务而献出自己的生命，这种士兵的信念是真实的和值得崇敬的”。霍姆斯在内战结束30年以后仍然把自己认同为一个士兵，他一直保留着后背笔直的军人举止，留着一个士兵特有的炫耀式的小胡子。他以这篇讲话为荣，因为据说当时的美国总统克里夫兰十分欣赏这篇讲话，1895年下半年克里夫兰在英属圭亚那与委内瑞拉的边界争端中采取侵略性的外交政策，可能还受了这篇讲话的影响。马萨诸塞州的参议员RichardOlney告诉霍姆斯，总统先生在办公室里向他大声朗读这篇讲话，几次激动得停了下来。一个无名的州法官可能影响了全球性的事件，想到这一点就让霍姆斯欣喜不已。他把这篇讲话复制了很多份送给朋友和熟人，强烈推荐他们去读他。但是克里夫兰却并没有因此表示想认识他。罗斯福当时还只是纽约城市政策委员会的委员，他读到讲话的出版稿后也万分激动，他给霍姆斯发去了贺电并提出要在波士顿和他会面，二人即因此而结识。<br><br>

霍姆斯的信件和讲话陆续出版，但随着法西斯阴影的迫近，人们慢慢看到了一个不太一样的霍姆斯。他的恶毒的犬儒主义，“终我一生我都对人类的自然权利嗤之以鼻”，道德不过就是“人们为了把自己当回事而发明出的把戏”，“那些还相信些什么东西的人们是一些多么该死的傻瓜……所有的‘主义’在我看来都是愚蠢可笑的”。他对天生犯罪人理论和优生学的推崇，在1927年的Buck v.Bell一案中，他支持了对低能妇女进行强制性绝育的立法，在司法意见中他写道：“三代的低能就足够了”。他对妇女权利和种族平等的轻视，在大部分美国人已经支持妇女投票权的年代，他仍然坚决反对，而他对此的解释是，“恕我直言，如果一个女人明确地问我问什么，我会回答她：‘喔女王，因为我是公牛’”。他在司法意见中称黑人是“缺乏智力和远见的冲动的人们”，他认为“平等是一种可耻的愿望”，而争取种族平等的努力是“可耻的错误”。还有他对军国主义的浪漫渲染，他声称“战争的消息是神圣的”，以及那篇帮他通向联邦最高院的臭名昭著的《士兵的信念》。所有这些都显示出同法西斯主义危险的亲缘关系，从1940年代开始，霍姆斯法官的神话开始破灭了，而他死去还不过十年，他的忧虑真的不幸而言中，他从他的fans们给他的位置上跌了下来。声讨他的极权主义哲学的文章层出不穷，天主教自然法学家还扩展了这些声讨，把他的政治哲学同他的实证主义、实用主义法律理论联系在一起。一位作者写道，“如果极权主义曾经成为美国政府的形式，毫无疑问，它的领袖肯定会册封赞助人之一为圣霍姆斯法官先生”。<br><br>

真实的霍姆斯是粗野的、尖刻的和冷酷的，是一个终生不渝的怨毒的悲观主义者，在人类生活中，他看到的只有富人和有权力的人把自己的意志强加于贫弱者的持续的斗争”，“后霍姆斯正统教义的铁杆信徒们只从他们的主人那里拿来适合他们需要的东西，而他的思想中令人不安的和异端的一面都被忽视了”。<br><br>
但是随着新保守主义的抬头，霍姆斯的神话不久就要再度重现了，因为每一种政治哲学，都会在政治斗争的轮回中改头换面地不断重现。“到了1970年代，看来对霍姆斯名誉的修正已经从他身上剥去了可以为当代利用的东西……很讽刺的是，把霍姆斯同进步自由主义者区分开来的被修正过的霍姆斯，其中的一些方面却使霍姆斯变得对保守的法律经济学运动特别有吸引力，今天可能已经很少有比理查德。A.波斯纳法官更忠实的霍姆斯主义者了”。波斯纳法官和霍姆斯法官都有同样坚定的对人性非道德的犬儒主义信念，同样的好做惊人之语的虚荣心，同样的对虚无的热情和同样的工作狂，除此之外，还有很多其他的气质上的亲和力，“他们都有刚性的（tough-minded）反情感主义，都有阴郁的马尔库塞式的观念，认为世界上没有免费的午餐，认为善意的财富再分配的努力都是徒劳，法律和实际上所有社会生活的最终基础都只是自利、领土防卫、复仇本能和生存斗争”。霍姆斯在1897年的演说《法律的道路》末尾预言法条主义者的时代就要过去，未来的法律应当属于经济学家和统计学家，在波斯纳看来，这不啻是法律经济学的福音书。自波斯纳出道以来，他用一个最忠实fans所可能有的所有智慧、勇气和热情，不遗余力地为霍姆斯法官的几乎所有理论辩护，预测理论、经验论、实用主义、对法律方法的怀疑、司法克制主义、道德怀疑主义、契约的选择理论，甚至霍姆斯的种族歧视和女性歧视也被他称赞为“司法的坦率”，那篇“三代的低能就足够了”的司法意见在波斯纳看来也写得那么美，在他自己的司法意见中他还刻意模仿：“三次提到山羊胡子就够了”，只有极权主义的敏感神经他还不敢触动。波斯纳法官的办公室里挂着霍姆斯法官的肖像，用吉尔莫的话来说，他在“芝加哥法律经济学神庙的万神殿里”为他的偶像霍姆斯建了一座“特别的祭坛”。波斯纳法官的著作里充斥了霍姆斯式的词汇，“经验”、“直觉”，还有“想象力”，只可惜他那东拉西扯、故意卖弄的文风总显得有些矫情，根本没有他的偶像霍姆斯那样的穿透力和震撼力，这说明魅力的平凡化原是一条无情的定律。波斯纳在他的新著《超越法律》中热情洋溢地说，如果德沃金《法律帝国》中那个海格里斯式的“超法官”在人间真能有正选的话，那就是他心中的最爱-奥利弗 霍姆斯，但是德沃金却对此嗤之以鼻。<br><br>

从骨子里，霍姆斯相信立法变革无从改变现代人的命运，“人们如果知道更多就不会选择这样做――但这又与我何干”。霍姆斯曾这样告诉他的学生法兰克福特：“如果法律反映了共同体中主导力量的意志，即便其将把我们带入地狱，那么此法律也是一部好的法律。”至于司法审查，霍姆斯则认为，“如果人们买了票，又确定知道他们的终点站，我就没有什么好说的了”。在个人世界中，霍姆斯信仰社会达尔文主义，相信优胜劣汰与适者生存的社会理念，认同强者支配弱者的权力哲学，认为那些规定最低工资和最高工时的立法难以为工人阶级从资本家那里分得一杯羹。但在司法裁决中，正是在洛克纳案的反对意见中，霍姆斯却指出美国宪法并未规定斯宾塞的社会静力学。霍姆斯坚决抵制把个人价值注入司法判决的诱惑，他曾经这样写道，“我憎恶我在判决中所支持的大多数政策”。<br><br>
霍姆斯是一位彻底的司法节制论者。1920年，霍姆斯在给拉斯基的信中这样写道：“即便我的同胞们要下地狱，我也只能帮助他们，因为这就是我的工作。”<br><br>
霍姆斯”。当过兵、杀过人，血统高贵，长得很酷，个子很高，留着尼采一样的小胡子，会写诗，做过无数煽情的演讲，有考究入时的穿着和军官风度，谈吐风雅，喜欢同年轻女人调情，五十多岁还有浪漫的跨国婚外情。所有这些，都使他成为美国法中最有趣的一个形象。他是美国梦的象征之一，他确实是属于美国的。<br><br>




THE SOLDIER'S FAITH<br><br>
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.<br><br>

[An Address Delivered on Memorial Day, May 30, 1895, at a Meeting Called by the Graduating Class of Harvard University. President Theodore Roosevelt's admiration for this speech was a factor in Holmes' nomination to the US Supreme Court. The most quoted line of this speech is "We have shared the incommunicable experience of war; we have felt, we still feel, the passion of life to its top."]<br><br>

Any day in Washington Street [in Boston], when the throng is greatest and busiest, you may see a blind man playing a flute. I suppose that some one hears him. Perhaps also my pipe may reach the heart of some passer in the crowd. <br><br>

I once heard a man say, "Where Vanderbilt sits, there is the head of the table. I teach my son to be rich." He said what many think. For although the generation born about 1840, and now governing the world, has fought two at least of the greatest wars in history, and has witnessed others, war is out of fashion, and the man who commands attention of his fellows is the man of wealth. Commerce is the great power. The aspirations of the world are those of commerce. Moralists and philosophers, following its lead, declare that war is wicked, foolish, and soon to disappear.<br><br>

The society for which many philanthropists, labor reformers, and men of fashion unite in longing is one in which they may be comfortable and may shine without much trouble or any danger. The unfortunately growing hatred of the poor for the rich seems to me to rest on the belief that money is the main thing (a belief in which the poor have been encouraged by the rich), more than on any other grievance. Most of my hearers would rather that their daughters or their sisters should marry a son of one of the great rich families than a regular army officer, were he as beautiful, brave, and gifted as Sir William Napier. I have heard the question asked whether our war was worth fighting, after all. There are many, poor and rich, who think that love of country is an old wife's tale, to be replaced by interest in a labor union, or, under the name of cosmopolitanism, by a rootless self-seeking search for a place where the most enjoyment may be had at the least cost.<br><br>

Meantime we have learned the doctrine that evil means pain, and the revolt aginst pain in all its forms has grown more and more marked. From societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals up to socialism, we express in numberless ways the notion that suffering is a wrong which can be and ought to be prevented, and a whole literature of sympathy has sprung into being which points out in story and in verse how hard it is to be wounded in the battle of life, how terrible, how unjust it is that any one should fail.<br><br>

Even science has had its part in the tendencies which we observe. It has shaken established religion in the minds of very many. It has pursued analysis until at last this thrilling world of colors and passions and sounds has seemed fatally to resolve itself into one vast network of vibrations endlessly weaving an aimless web, and the rainbow flush of cathedral windows, which once to enraptured eyes appeared the very smile of God, fades slowly out into the pale irony of the void.<br><br>

And yet from vast orchestras still comes the music of mighty symphonies. Our painters even now are spreading along the walls of our Library glowing symbols of mysteries still real, and the hardly silenced cannon of the East proclaim once more that combat and pain still are the portion of man. For my own part, I believe that the struggle for life is the order of the world, at which it is vain to repine. I can imagine the burden changed in the way it is to be borne, but I cannot imagine that it ever will be lifted from men's backs. I can imagine a future in which science shall have passed from the combative to the dogmatic stage, and shall have gained such catholic acceptance that it shall take control of life, and condemn at once with instant execution what now is left for nature to destroy. But we are far from such a future, and we cannot stop to amuse or to terrify ourselves with dreams. Now, at least, and perhaps as long as man dwells upon the globe, his destiny is battle, and he has to take the chances of war. If it is our business to fight, the book for the army is a war-song, not a hospital-sketch. It is not well for soldiers to think much about wounds. Sooner or later we shall fall; but meantime it is for us to fix our eyes upon the point to be stormed, and to get there if we can. <br><br>

Behind every scheme to make the world over, lies the question, What kind of world do you want? The ideals of the past for men have been drawn from war, as those for women have been drawn from motherhood. For all our prophecies, I doubt if we are ready to give up our inheritance. Who is there who would not like to be thought a gentleman? Yet what has that name been built on but the soldier's choice of honor rather than life? To be a soldier or descended from soldiers, in time of peace to be ready to give one's life rather than suffer disgrace, that is what the word has meant; and if we try to claim it at less cost than a splendid carelessness for life, we are trying to steal the good will without the responsibilities of the place. We will not dispute about tastes. The man of the future may want something different. But who of us could endure a world, although cut up into five-acre lots, and having no man upon it who was not well fed and well housed, without the divine folly of honor, without the senseless passion for knowledge outreaching the flaming bounds of the possible, without ideals the essence of which is that they can never be achieved? I do not know what is true. I do not know the meaning of the universe. But in the midst of doubt, in the collapse of creeds, there is one thing I do not doubt, that no man who lives in the same world with most of us can doubt, and that is that the faith is true and adorable which leads a soldier to throw away his life in obedience to a blindly accepted duty, in a cause which he little understands, in a plan of campaign of which he has little notion, under tactics of which he does not see the use. <br><br>

Most men who know battle know the cynic force with which the thoughts of common sense will assail them in times of stress; but they know that in their greatest moments faith has trampled those thoughts under foot. If you wait in line, suppose on Tremont Street Mall, ordered simply to wait and do nothing, and have watched the enemy bring their guns to bear upon you down a gentle slope like that of Beacon Street, have seen the puff of the firing, have felt the burst of the spherical case-shot as it came toward you, have heard and seen the shrieking fragments go tearing through your company, and have known that the next or the next shot carries your fate; if you have advanced in line and have seen ahead of you the spot you must pass where the rifle bullets are striking; if you have ridden at night at a walk toward the blue line of fire at the dead angle of Spottsylvania, where for twenty-four hours the soldiers were fighting on the two sides of an earthwork, and in the morning the dead and dying lay piled in a row six deep, and as you rode you heard the bullets splashing in the mud and earth about you; if you have been in the picket-line at night in a black and unknown wood, have heard the splat of the bullets upon the trees, and as you moved have felt your foot slip upon a dead man's body; if you have had a blind fierce gallop against the enemy, with your blood up and a pace that left no time for fear --if, in short, as some, I hope many, who hear me, have known, you have known the vicissitudes of terror and triumph in war; you know that there is such a thing as the faith I spoke of. You know your own weakness and are modest; but you know that man has in him that unspeakable somewhat which makes him capable of miracle, able to lift himself by the might of his own soul, unaided, able to face anniliation for a blind belief. <br><br>

From the beginning, to us, children of the North, life has seemed a place hung about by dark mists, out of which comes the pale shine of dragon's scales and the cry of fighting men, and the sound of swords. Beowolf, Milton, Durer, Rembrandt, Schopenhauer, Turner, Tennyson, from the first war song of the race to the stall-fed poetry of modern English drawing rooms, all have had the same vision, and all have had a glimpse of a light to be followed. "The end of wordly life awaits us all. Let him who may, gain honor ere death. That is best for a warrior when he is dead." So spoke Beowolf a thousand years ago.<br><br>

Not of the sunlight, <br><br>
 Not of the moonlight,<br><br>
 Not of the starlight! <br><br>
 O Young Mariner, <br><br>
 Down to the haven.<br><br>
 Call your companions,<br><br>
 Launch your vessel, <br><br>
 And crowd your canvas.<br><br>
 And, ere it vanishes <br><br>
 Over the margin, <br><br>
 After it, follow it, <br><br>
 Follow the Gleam.<br><br>

So sang Tennyson in the voice of the dying Merlin.<br><br>

When I went to the war I thought that soldiers were old men. I remembered a picture of the revolutionary soldier which some of you may have seen, representing a white-haired man with his flint-lock slung across his back. I remembered one or two examples of revolutionary soldiers wom I have met, and I took no account of the lapse of time. It was not long after, in winter quarters, as I was listening to some of the sentimental songs in vogue, such as--<br><br>

Farewell, Mother, you may never<br><br>
See your darling boy again,<br><br>

that it came over me that the army was made up of what I should now call very young men. I dare say that my illusion has been shared by some of those now present, as they have looked at us upon whose heads the white shadows have begun to fall. But the truth is that war is the business of youth and early middle age. You who called this assemblage together, not we, would be the soldiers of another war, if we should have one, and we speak to you as the dying Merlin did in the verse which I have just quoted. Would that the blind man's pipe might be transformed by Merlin's magic, to make you hear the bugles as once we heard them beneath the morning stars! For you it is that now is sung the Song of the Sword:--<br><br>

The War-Thing, the Comrade, <br><br>
 Father of Honor, <br><br>
 And Giver of kingship,<br><br>
 The fame-smith, the song master.<br><br>
 Priest (saith the Lord)<br><br>
Of his marriage with victory<br><br>
...
 Clear singing, clean slicing;<br><br>
 Sweet spoken, soft finishing;<br><br>
 Making death beautiful<br><br>
 Life but a coin<br><br>
To be staked in a pastime<br><br>
Whose playing is more<br><br>
Than the transfer of being;<br><br>
Arch-anarch, chief builder, <br><br>
Prince and evangelist,<br><br>
I am the Will of God:<br><br>
 I am the Sword.<br><br>

War, when you are at it, is horrible and dull. It is only when time has passed that you see that its message was divine. I hope it may be long before we are called again to sit at that master's feet. But some teacher of the kind we all need. In this snug, over-safe corner of the world we need it, that we may realize that our comfortable routine is no eternal necessity of things, but merely a little space of calm in the midst of the tempestuous untamed streaming of the world, and in order that we may be ready for danger. We need it in this time of individualist negations, with its literature of French and American humor, revolting at discipline, loving flesh-pots, and denying that anything is worthy of reverence--in order that we may remember all that buffoons forget. We need it everywhere and at all times. For high and dangerous action teaches us to believe as right beyond dispute things for which our doubting minds are slow to find words of proof. Out of heroism grows faith in the worth of heroism. The proof comes later, and even may never come. Therefore I rejoice at every dangerous sport which I see pursued. The students at Heidelberg, with their sword-slashed faces, inspire me with sincere respect. I gaze with delight upon our polo players. If once in a while in our rough riding a neck is broken, I regard it, not as a waste, but as a price well paid for the breeding of a race fit for headship and command.<br><br>

We do not save our traditions, in our country. The regiments whose battle-flags were not large enough to hold the names of the battles they had fought vanished with the surrender of Lee, although their memories inherited would have made heroes for a century. It is the more necessary to learn the lesson afresh from perils newly sought, and perhaps it is not vain for us to tell the new generation what we learned in our day, and what we still believe. That the joy of life is living, is to put out all one's powers as far as they will go; that the measure of power is obstacles overcome; to ride boldly at what is in front of you, be it fence or enemy; to pray, not for comfort, but for combat; to keep the soldier's faith against the doubts of civil life, more besetting and harder to overcome than all the misgivings of the battlefield, and to remember that duty is not to be proved in the evil day, but then to be obeyed unquestioning; to love glory more than the temptations of wallowing ease, but to know that one's final judge and only rival is oneself: with all our failures in act and thought, these things we learned from noble enemies in Virginia or Georgia or on the Mississippi, thirty years ago; these things we believe to be true.<br><br>

"Life is not lost", said she,<br><br>
"for which is bought Endless renown."<br><br>

We learned also, and we still believe, that love of country is not yet an idle name.<br><br>

Deare countrey! O how dearly deare <br><br>
Ought thy rememberance, and perpetuall band<br><br>
Be to thy foster child, that from thy hand<br><br>
Did commun breath and nouriture receave!<br><br>
How brutish is it not to understand<br><br>
How much to her we owe, that all us gave; <br><br>
That much to her we owe, that all us gave;<br><br>
That gave unto us all, whatever good we have!<br><br>

As for us, our days of combat are over. Our swords are rust. Our guns will thunder no more. The vultures that once wheeled over our heads must be buried with their prey. Whatever of glory must be won in the council or the closet, never again in the field. I do not repine. We have shared the incommunicable experience of war; we have felt, we still feel, the passion of life to its top.<br><br>

Three years ago died the old colonel of my regiment, the Twentieth Massachusetts. [Web note: Col. William Raymond Lee] He gave the regiment its soul. No man could falter who heard his "Forward, Twentieth!" I went to his funeral. From a side door of the church a body of little choir- boys came in alike a flight of careless doves. At the same time the doors opened at the front, and up the main aisle advanced his coffin, followed by the few grey heads who stood for the men of the Twentieth, the rank and file whom he had loved, and whom he led for the last time. The church was empty. No one remembered the old man whom we were burying, no one save those next to him, and us. And I said to myself, The Twentieth has shrunk to a skeleton, a ghost, a memory, a forgotten name which we other old men alone keep in our hearts. And then I thought: It is right. It is as the colonel would have it. This also is part of the soldier's faith: Having known great things, to be content with silence. Just then there fell into my hands a little song sung by a warlike people on the Danube, which seemed to me fit for a soldier's last word, another song of the sword, but a song of the sword in its scabbard, a song of oblivion and peace.<br><br>

A soldier has been buried on the battlefield.<br><br>

 

And when the wind in the tree-tops roared,<br><br>
 The soldier asked from the deep dark grave:<br><br>
 "Did the banner flutter then?"<br><br>
 "Not so, my hero," the wind replied.<br><br>
 "The fight is done, but the banner won, <br><br>
 Thy comrades of old have borne it hence, <br><br>
 Have borne it in triumph hence."<br><br>
 Then the soldier spake from the deep dark grave:<br><br>
 "I am content." <br><br>

Then he heareth the lovers laughing pass, <br><br>
 and the soldier asks once more:<br><br>
 "Are these not the voices of them that love, <br><br>
 That love--and remember me?"<br><br>
 "Not so, my hero," the lovers say,<br><br>
 "We are those that remember not;<br><br>
 For the spring has come and the earth has smiled,<br><br>
 And the dead must be forgot."<br><br>
 Then the soldier spake from the deep dark grave:<br><br>
 "I am content."<br><br>

might is right 	<br><br>
GEORGE VI (r. 1936-1952)<br><br>
Broadcast, outbreak of war with Germany, 3 September 1939<br><br>
 


In this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas, this message, spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself.<br><br>

For the second time in the lives of most of us, we are at war.<br><br>

Over and over again, we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies; but it has been in vain.<br><br>

We have been forced into a conflict, for we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world.<br><br>

It is a principle which permits a state, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges, which sanctions the use of force or threat of force against the sovereignty and independence of other states.<br><br>

Such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right（强权即公理）, and if this principle were established through the world, the freedom of our own country and of the whole British Commonwealth of nations would be in danger.<br><br>

But far more than this, the peoples of the world would be kept in bondage of fear, and all hopes of settled peace and of the security, of justice and liberty, among nations, would be ended.<br><br>

This is the ultimate issue which confronts us.  For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, and of the world order and peace, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.<br><br>

It is to this high purpose that I now call my people at home, and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own.<br><br>

I ask them to stand calm and firm and united in this time of trial.<br><br>

The task will be hard.  There may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield, but we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to God.  If one and all we keep resolutely faithful to it, ready for whatever service or sacrifice it may demand, then with God's help, we shall prevail.<br><br>

May He bless and keep us all. <br><br>
