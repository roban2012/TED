I have endeavored to use the methods of analytic philosophy to guide a critical appraisal of modern American law. My focus has been on the twin preoccupations of the legal establishment in its rationalizing moods. One is a preoccupation with the autonomy of legal reasoning as a methodology of decision making. The other is a preoccupation with objectivity-here used in the strong sense that persons with different political or ideological commitments can nevertheless be brought to agree on the answer to even the most testing, the most politically charged, legal question-as a goal of the legal enterprise. I have emphasized the precarious position of the judge, forced to make unpopular decisions-every judicial decision is unpopular with one of the parties and with those in the same position as that party-without the intrinsic authority of the more "organic" (popular, authentically sovereign) branches of government from which the judiciary has studiously and even ostentatiously separated itself in an effort to secure political independence.<br><br>
The creation of an independent judiciary involves a substitution of professionalism, of expertise, for political legitimacy and sets up the eternal tension between law and politics in the discharge of the judicial function, a tension mirrored on the jurisprudential plane in the age-old dispute between Legalists and Skeptics.<br><br>
What I have j ust said is familiar enough. Any novelty is in the bill of particulars that I have drawn up against the defenders of law's autonomy and obj ectivity-the formalists, as one might call them, because the essence of formalism is to conceive oflaw as a system of relations among ideas rather than as a social practice. I do not reject formalism tout court; not only are there immensely worthwhile formal systems such as logic, mathematics, and art, but logic has an important role to play in legal decision making. I reject the exaggerated legal formalism that considers relations among legal ideas to be the essence of law and legal thought.<br><br>
Formalism in this sense is sometimes thought a discredited position in law. This is far from true. Many of the most powerful minds in the profession are formalists, whether or not they use the label; and at this writing the formalist style is resurgent in the Supreme Court and in the lower federal courts as well. Formalism is the official jurisprudence of lawyers and lay people alike, and of both positivists and natural lawyers, although not of all individuals in either camp.<br><br>
Let me review very briefly the main points of the analysis. I began with the epistemological and ontological dimensions of adj udication and searched for keys that might enable cogent answers, offered from within the conventions of legal argument and evidence, to be given to difficult questions, both legal and factual. No keys were found. The constructive
as distinct from the critical role of logic in law (the critical role being to expose inconsistencies), though important, is limited. For while rules have a logical structure, legal rules are often vague, open-ended, tenuously grounded, highly contestable, and not only alterable but frequently altered. From the judge's standpoint they are more like guides or practices than like orders. The role of scientific inquiry in law is also limited, partly because of attitude and tradition but partly too because of essential characteristics of the legal enterprise, in particular the value rightly placed on the stability, certainty, and predictability of legal obligations.<br><br>
Unable to base decision in the difficult cases on either logic or science, judges are compelled to fall back on the grab bag of informal methods of reasoning that I call "practical reason" (using the term in a slightly unorthodox sense) . These methods often succeed but sometimes fail; in any event they owe less than one might think to legal training and experience.<br><br>
In particular, reasoning by analogy has been oversold as a method of reasoning at once cogent and distinctively legal. It is neither. The power of an analogy is as a stimulus to thinking. The law seeks a logic of justification rather than merely or primarily a logic of discovery. As a method of justification, reasoning by analogy is really either enthymematic (that is, deductive) or weakly inductive, rather than being its own kind of thing; and whatever it is, there is nothing distinctively legal about it. Precedents that are squarely on point do have authority in a court of law, but their authority is political-that is, rooted ultimately in force-rather than epistemic in character. Judges follow the previous decisions of their court when they agree with them or when they deem legal stability more important in the circumstances than getting the law right. 1 But a precedent's analogical significance means simply that the precedent contains information relevant to the decision of the present case.<br><br>
Many changes of legal doctrine owe nothing either to analogies (except insofar as they operate as similes or metaphors-powerful though alogical modes of persuasion) or to logically or empirically powerful arguments or evidence. In stead they are the result of gestalt switches or religious-type conversions. Indeed, of such limited power are the tools of inquiry available to courts that the highest realistic aspiration of a judge faced with a difficult case is to make a "reasonable" (practical, sensible) decision, as distinct from a demonstrably correct one-the latter will usually be out of the question. The ingredients of reasonableness include, but are not exhausted in, conventional legal materials such as precedents and the principles for using precedents. Often the judge will have no choice but to reason to the outcome by nonlegal methods from nonlegal materials, and sometimes he will have to set inarticulable intuition against legal arguments.<br><br>
I have emphasized the difficulties, in the forensic setting, of factual as well as of legal analysis and noted that often the legal system settles for "formal" rather than "substantive" accuracy-that is, settles for procedural rules (such as rules on burden of proof) that force determinacy on outcomes notwithstanding irresolvable factual uncertainties. Uncertainty about matters of fact pervades efforts not only to determine what happened in the dispute that gave rise to the litigation but also to measure the consequences of legal doctrines, and as a result the factual substrate of those doctrines often is tenuous. And, partly for evidentiary reasons, partly for deeper philosophical ones, the law's  stensible commitment to a rich mentalist ontology of free will, intent, and the like turns out to be superficial. As Holmes said, the law deals with externals.<br><br>
The operative model of human action in such fields as criminal law is a behaviorist (determinist) one; even the concept of a " voluntary" confession is seen to be determinist in character.<br><br>
Law itself is best approached in behaviorist terms. It cannot accurately or usefully be described as a set of concepts, whether of positive law or of natural law. It is better, though not fully, described as the activity of the licensed professionals we call j udges, the scope of their license being limited only by the diffuse outer bounds of professional propriety and moral consensus. Holmes was on the right track in proposing the prediction theory of law, which is an activity theory; his critics have been too quick to dismiss it. Redescribing law in activity terms tends to erase the distinction between natural law and positive law, and the distinction has indeed outlived its usefulness. Judges make rather than find law, and they use as inputs both the rules laid down by legislatures and previous courts ("positive law") and their own ethical and policy preferences.<br><br>
These preferences are all that remains of "natural law," now that so many of us have lost confidence that nature  onstitutes a normative order.<br><br>
If epistemology and ontology will not save the law's obj ectivity and autonomy, neither will hermeneutics. Neither interpretive theory in the large nor the rich literature on legal interpretation (a real embarrassment of riches)2 will underwrite objective interpretations of common law, statutes, or the Constitution. Of course one can go too far with interpretive skepticism. Communication works-verifiably so-and statutes and constitutional provisions are efforts at communication. But often in dealing with statutes and the Constitution the channels of communication are obstructed, and when that happens the concept of interpretation is altogether too loose and vague to discipline legal inquiry. We see this when we ask what the goal of legal interpretation is and discover that there is no agreed-upon answer to the question and no rational means of compelling agreement, that it all depends on the interpreter's political theory. We might do best to discard the term "interpretation" and focus directly on the consequences of proposed applications of statutory and constitutional provisions to specific disputes. <br><br>
The situation for the defenders of law's autonomy and obj ectivity is not improved when the searchlight is trained on overarching principles that might organize and discipline legal inquiry. Natural law as the name for ethical and policy considerations that bear on the exercise of judicial discretion-considerations such as those encapsulated in the equity
maxims (for example, no man shall profit from his wrongdoing and pacta sunt servanda)-is in fine shape. But natural law as a system of thought that generates definite answers to difficult moral and legal questions is hopeless in a society that is morally heterogeneous, as ours is.<br><br>
Distributive justice cannot replace natural law, for it too is riven by unbridgeable political disagreements. Although corrective justice, which is rooted in our deep-seated retributive emotions, arid wealth maximization-especially, I think, the latter-have significant domains of application, particularly to common law, neither can provide a complete framework that will enable adj udication to be made determinate. Nor can the literary, feminist, and communitarian perspectives that are receiving increasing attention or the nostalgia-soaked movement to return to traditional legalism via philosophy that I call neotraditionalism provide comprehensive frameworks for adjudication. The cat is out of the bag. Efforts in this scientific and pluralistic age to regain a confident sense in the law's autonomy and objectivity seem futile. Yet the radical skepticism and vague communitarian yearnings of critical legal studies are a dead end too.<br><br>
The underlying problem can be stated simply. Law uses a crude methodology to deal with extremely difficult questions. The crudeness is concealed when no other inquirers have a powerful methodology, and now they do, thanks to advances in natural and social science. The difficulty is concealed when the legal establishment is homogeneous, for then its priors and prejudices fix the necessary premises for confident decision. As a result of social and political changes, America no longer has a homogeneous legal establishment. The more diverse the judiciary, the more robust are the decisions that command strong support within it-but the less likely is a given decision to command such support and the more exposed, therefore, is the contingency of legal doctrine. Some lawyers and judges believe that a diverse j udiciary is bad, because it makes law uncertain, unpredictable. They have a point. But from the standpoint not of order but of knowledge, they are wrong. A diverse j udiciary exposes-yet at the same time reduces-the intellectual poverty of law, viewed as a method not just of settling disputes authoritatively but also of generating cogent answers to social questions.<br><br>
A diverse j udiciary must be distinguished from a judiciary selected on the basis of racial and sexual politics. Of course persons of a different race or sex from that of most j udges may have relevant life experiences that contribute to the moral and intellectual diversity of the bench, but this is also true of individuals of different religious and  professional background, different temperament, different health, and even different hobbies. A machinery of j udicial selection that merely seeks a balance among clamoring, politically effective interest groups will not generate an optimally diverse judiciary.<br><br>
The concept of law that has emerged here can be summarized in the following theses. First, there is no such thing as "legal reasoning."<br><br>
Lawyers and judges answer legal questions through the use of simple logic and the various methods of practical reasoning that everyday thinkers use. In part because of the law's (salutary) emphasis on stability, the scientific attitude and the methodology of science are not at home in law.<br><br>
Second, partly for the reason just given, partly because many methods of practical reason are inarticulate (for example, tacit knowledge) , partly because "prejudgment" in the sense of resistance to rational arguments that contradict strong priors often is itself rational, partly because there is little feedback in the legal process (that is, the consequences of judicial decisions are largely unknown), the justification (akin to scientific verification) of legal decisions-the demonstration that a decision is correct- often is impossible.<br><br>
Third, a closely related point is that difficult legal cases can rarely be decided objectively if obj ectivity is taken to mean more than reasonableness.<br><br>
The more uniform the j udiciary is, however, the more agreement there will be on the premises for decision, and therefore the fewer difficult cases there will be. I have stressed both the costs of this uniformity and the degree of disuniformity in the contemporary American judiciary. But it should be borne in mind that even within a j udiciary as diverse as ours, there will be many shared intuitions (of course, it could be more diverse, and then there would be fewer) , which will provide premises for objective decision making. Moral and legal nihilism is as untenable as moral realism or legal formalism.<br><br>
Fourth, large changes in law often come about as a result of a nonrational process akin to conversion. Rhetoric in the sense of persuasion not necessarily addressed to the rational intellect (the sense famously criticized by Plato in Gorgias) may change the law as much as hard reality does.<br><br>
Fifth, law is an activity rather than a concept or a group of concepts.<br><br>
No bounds can be fixed a priori on what shall be allowed to count as an argument in law. The modern significance of natural law is not as a body of objective norms that underwrite positive law but as a source of the ethical and political arguments that j udges use to challenge, change, or elaborate positive law-in other words to produce new positive law.<br><br>
There are no moral "reals" (at least none available to decide difficult legal cases), but neither is there a body of positive law that somehow preexists the judicial decisions applying, and in the process confirming, modifying, extending, and rej ecting, the "sovereign's " commands. The line between positive law and natural law is no longer interesting or important and the concepts themselves are j ejune.<br><br>
Sixth, there is no longer a useful sense in which law is interpretive.<br><br>
This is true of statutory and constitutional law as well as common law. Interpretation butters no parsnips; it is at best a reminder that there is a text in the picture (and there is not even that in common law fields) .<br><br>
The essence of interpretive decision making is considering the consequences of alternative decisions. There are no  logically" correct interpretations; interpretation is not a logical process.<br><br>
Seventh, there are no overarching concepts of justice that our legal system can seize upon to give direction to the enterprise. (This point is related to the earlier one about the absence of moral "reals.") Corrective justice and wealth maximization have important but limited domains of applicability, the former reflecting the residue of vengeance thinking in law and society, the latter the persistent utilitarian, instrumentalist, pragmatic spirit of American society. Distributive justice seems quite hopeless, however, and it has yet to be shown that the literary, feminist, or communitarian perspectives have much to contribute to the legal enterprise that is both new and useful. The prudentialism of a Burke has cautionary value in law, but that may be all.<br><br>
And eighth, law is functional, not expressive or symbolic either in aspiration or-so far as yet appears-in effect. Hence in areas where the social function is the efficient allocation of resources, law appropriately takes its cue from economics. The law is not interested in the soul or even the mind. It has adopted a severely behaviorist concept of human
activity as sufficient to its ends and tractable to its means. It has yet to be shown that law changes people's attitudes toward compliance with social norms, as distinct from altering their incentives.<br><br>
All this is not to deny the indispensability of law or the importance of its contributions to civilized society. But it amounts to a less than thrilling vision of law. It is remote from "law day" rhetoric and even from most academic views of law. <br><br>
Yet a pragmatist might ask what all this nay-saying, this carping, this harping on dubiety, this heaping on of wet blankets, is good for. I am not claiming that the condition of law spells a crisis for capitalism or the liberal state. I have not presented dramatic proposals for improvement.<br><br>
Although I can imagine radical changes in the legal system that would imbue legal institutions with greater respect for scientific methodology, I am not sure they would be justified, given the competing social functions that law serves. Have I, therefore, ended at dead center, violating Voltaire's dictum (im proving on Socrates) to be moderate in everything, including moderation?<br><br>
My colleagues in the legal profession will not consider the picture of law that I have painted merely a dull monochrome; some of them will even say that I have announced " the death of law." And the approach has practical as well as conceptual or atmospheric implications, only a few of which I have tried to draw out in this book. A moment ago I remarked the pros and cons of a diverse j udiciary, and the remark bears on the perennial proposal for an Intercircuit Tribunal that would on reference from the Supreme Court resolve conflicts among the federal courts of appeal that the Supreme Court lacks the time to resolve.3 At first glance it might seem that the resolution of conflicts that generate legal uncertainty would be an unequivocal good, so that the only question about the proposal would be its cost (principally delay) , the difficulties of staffing such a tribunal, and so forth. But from a pragmatic perspective the main concern is with the danger of  remature closure of legal debate. Intercircuit conflict provides a method of unforced inquiry in the nation's most important judicial system. Of course debate continues after the judges have ruled, and sometimes their decision is overruled.<br><br>
But once a national precedent is laid down and begins to accrete reliance and interest-group support, it may be difficult to overrule, however powerful the criticisms of it. So intercircuit conflict has epistemic value that must be traded off against the undoubted loss in legal certainty from the absence of a method for prompt resolution of all intercircuit conflicts. My analysis also suggests a more hospitable attitude toward judicial dissents than is found in some circles. They are not only, as they so often seem to be, a nuisance (my frequent reaction as a judge) . They compromise the authoritarian character of law, but in doing so they exemplify unforced inquiry, of which American law could perhaps use more. To quote William Blake, " without contraries is no progression. "<br><br>
I would stress the implications of my analysis for research-in the suggestions, for example, in Chapter 2 that a careful study would show that specialized courts are less rather than more attentive to precedent than generalist courts, in Chapter 3 that we ought to study the effects of an inefficient state legal system on the state's welfare and the feedback effect on the legal system, and in Chapter 6 that conviction of the innocent is less rather than, as one might think, more common in a society in which the crime rate is high. There are implications, too, for teaching (it is a scandal that law students are not instructed in the fundamentals of statistical inference) , for practice (legal advocates should place much greater emphasis on facts and on policy than they do) , and for judging Qudges should at long last abandon the rhetoric, and the reality, of formalist adj udication) . I have proposed a new explanation of the pattern of the codced-confession cases-that under the rubric of "involuntariness" some voluntary confessions are excluded from evidence in criminal trials because they are unreliable and some reliable confessions are excluded because they are involuntary on a determinist account of "free will"-and a new approach to statutory interpretation. And I have embraced (or rej ected, which comes to the same thing) both legal positivism and natural law.<br><br>
But the most important implications have to do with attitudes. The traditional-and neotraditional, and liberal, and radical-pieties of jurisprudence should be discarded, and the legal enterprise reconceived in pragmatic terms. Once this is done the dichotomy between legal positivism and natural law collapses, with no loss. But I do not suggest that it is easy to change attitudes. The attack on foundations, on certitudes, on tradition, on Grand Theories owes much, as I have emphasized throughout, to the pragmatist tradition. It is a pity that it is so hard to define the tradition, both generally and in relation to law. Conventional histories of pragmatism begin with Charles Sanders Peirce, although he himself gave credit for the basic idea to a lawyer friend, Nicholas St. John Green. From Peirce the baton was handed to William James, then to John Dewey, George Mead, and the British pragmatist, F. S. C. Schiller. The pragmatic movement gave legal realism much of its intellectual shape and content.<br><br>
But with the coming of World War II, both philosophical pragmatism and legal realism seemed to expire, the first  uperseded by logical positivism and other " hard" analytic philosophy, the second absorbed into the legal mainstream and particularly into the "legal process" school that was to reach its apogee in the 1 950s . Then, beginning in the 1 960s with the waning of logical positivism, pragmatism came charging back in the person of Richard Rorty, followed in the 1 970s by critical legal studiesthe radical child of legal realism-and in the 1 980s by a school of legal neopragmatists, including some feminists. In this account pragmatism, whether of the paleo- or the neovariety, stands for a progressively more emphatic rejection of Enlightenment dualisms such as subject and object, mind and body, perception and reality, form and substance, these dualisms being regarded as the props of a conservative social, political, and legal order.<br><br>
This picture is too simple by far. The triumphs of science, and particularly of Newtonian physics, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries persuaded most thinking people that the physical universe had a uniform structure accessible to human reason; and it began to seem that human nature and human social systems might have a similarly mechanical structure. This emerging worldview cast humankind in an observing mold. Through perception, measurement, and mathematics the human mind would uncover the secrets of nature-including the mind as a part of nature and the laws of social inte{actions: laws that decreed balanced government, economic behavior in accordance with the principles of supply and demand, and moral and legal principles based on immutable principles of psychology and human behavior. The mind was a camera, recording activities both natural and social and alike determined by natural laws .<br><br>
This view, broadly scientific but flavored with a Platonic sense of a world of order behind the chaos of sense impressions, was challenged by the Romantic poets (such as Blake and Wordsworth) and Romantic philosophers. They emphasized the plasticity of the world, and especially the esemplastic power of the human imagination. Institutional constraints they despised along with all other limits on human aspiration, as merely contingent; science they found dreary; they celebrated the sense of community-of oneness with humankind and with nature-the sense of unlimited potential, that an infant feels. They were Prometheans. The principal American representative of this school was Emerson, and he left traces of his thought on Peirce and Holmes alike.<br><br>
Emerson's European counterpart (and admirer) was Nietzsche. It is not that Peirce, or Holmes, or even Nietzsche was a " Romantic" in a precise sense (if there is a precise sense) . It is that they wished to shift attention from a passive, contemplative relation between an observing subject and an objective reality, whether natural or social, to an active, creative relation between striving human beings and the problems that beset them and that they seek to overcome. They believed that thought was an exertion of will instrumental to some human desire (and we see here the link between pragmatism and utilitarianism), and that social institutions-whether science, law, or religion-were the product of shifting human desires rather than the reflection of a reality external to those desires.<br><br>
This account should help us see why "truth" is a problematic concept for a pragmatist. Its essential meaning, after all, is observer independence, which is just what the pragmatist is inclined to deny. It is no surprise, therefore, that the pragmatists' stabs at defining truth-truth is what is fated to be believed in the long run (Peirce) , truth is what is
good to believe Qames), or truth is what survives in the competition among ideas (Holmes)-are riven by paradox. The pragmatist's real interest is not in truth at all but in belief justified by social need.<br><br>
This need not make the pragmatist unfriendly to science-far from it-but it shifts the emphasis in the philosophy of science from the discovery of nature's laws by observation to the formulation of theories about nature (including man and society) on the basis of man's desire to predict and control his environment, both social and natural. The implication, later to become explicit in the writings of Thomas Kuhn, is that scientific theories are a function of human need and desire rather than of the way things are in nature, so that the succession of theories on a given topic need not produce a linear growth in scientific knowledge. Science in the pragmatic view is a social enterprise. <br><br>
The spirit of pragmatism is not limited to the handful of philosophers who have called themselves pragmatists (and a tiny handful it is-Peirce himself, the founder, having renounced the term because he disagreed with William James's definition of it) . Rival of pragmatism though it is thought to be, logical positivism, with its emphasis on verifiability and its consequent hostility to metaphysics, is pragmatic in demanding that theory make a difference in the world of fact, the empirical world. Popper's falsificationist philosophy of science is close to Peirce's view of science, for in both philosophies doubt is the engine of progress and truth an ever-receding goal rather than an attainment. Wittgenstein's emphasis on the "sociality" of knowledge marks him as pragmatist, while Habermas has acknowledged the influence of the pragmatists on his own theory of " conversational" rationality. Plainly we are dealing with an immensely diverse tradition rather than with a single, coherent school of thought.<br><br>
Latterly pragmatism has come to be thought a left-wing ideology, a celebration of the plasticity of social institutions. The discussion in Chapter 1 2 of a recent article by Richard Rorty shows why, and Rorty is not even on the left of the neopragmatist movement. But the connection between pragmatism and socialism is adventitious. Rorty is a Romanticist, and this is only one of the flavors that pragmatism comes in. Pragmatism in the sense that I find congenial means looking at problems concretely, experimentally, without illusions, with full awareness of the limitations of human reason, with a sense of the "localness" of human knowledge, the difficulty of translations between cultures, the unattainability of " truth," the consequent importance of keeping diverse paths of inquiry open, the dependence of inquiry on culture and social institutions, and above all the insistence that social thought and action be evaluated as instruments to valued human goals rather than as ends in themselves. These dispositions, which are more characteristic of scientists than of lawyers (and in an important sense pragmatism is the ethics of scientific inquiry) , have no political valence. They can, I believe, point the way to a clearer understanding of law. Law as currently conceived in the academy and the j udiciary has too theocratic a cast. There is too much emphasis on authority, certitude, rhetoric, and tradition, too little on consequences and on social-scientific techniques for measuring consequences. There is too much confidence, too little
curiosity, and insufficient regard for the contributions of other disciplines.<br><br>
Jurisprudence itself is much too solemn and self-important. Its votaries write too marmoreal, hieratic, and censorious a prose. Law and religion were long intertwined, and many parallels and overlaps remain . 4 Law, too, has its high priests, its sacred texts and sacred cows, its hermeneutic mysteries, its robes and temples, rituals and ceremomes.<br><br>
Admittedly, much that I am complaining about is surface rather than substance, for on the whole the law has been shaped by practical needs (the same may be true of religion) . Influential j udicial decisions as diverse as Farwell (the fellow-servant case) and Barnette (the second flagsalute case)-one conservative, the other liberal, as these terms are used today; one common law, the other constitutional law; one decided in 1 842, the other in 1 943-are quintessentially pragmatic. Still, law needs more of the scientific spirit than it has-the spirit of inquiry, challenge, fallibilism, open-mindedness, respect for fact, and acceptance of change. <br><br>
I use "spirit" advisedly. I am not referring to the particulars of scientific discourse, although economics and other social sciences have a large role to play in any modern system of law. 5<br><br>
I find pragmatism bracing; others may find it paralyzing. Pragmatist skepticism about "truth" might, for example, be thought to undermine the nation's commitment to free speech. If there is no truth "out there," how can free speech be defended by reference to its efficacy in bringing us nearer to truth?6 Actually that is not such a difficult question. If there is no truth out there, this should make us particularly wary of people who claim to have found the truth and who argue that further inquiry would be futile or subversive and therefore should be forbidden. If there is no objective truth, moreover, this makes it all the more important to maintain the conditions necessary for the unforced inquiry required to challenge and defeat all those false claims to have found the truth at last.<br><br>
There is knowledge if not ultimate truth, 7 and a fallibilist theory of knowledge emphasizes, as preconditions to the growth of scientific and other forms of knowledge, the continual testing and retesting of accepted "truths," the constant kicking over of sacred cows-in short, a commitment to robust and free-wheeling inquiry with no intellectual quarter asked or given.<br><br>
Such a theory is wary of proposals to give less protection to scientific han to political freedom of expression on the ground that scientific truth is objectively determinable and therefore need not be left to the hurly-burly of the marketplace of ideas, or to limit protection of artistic expression on the superficially inconsistent ground that fiction is parasitic on and therefore less important than fact. 8 If, consistent with the skepticism of the pragmatist, we rej ect essentialist ideas of art and moral-realist ideas of offensiveness, we deny the competence of courts to condemn expressive works on the ground that their offensiveness outweighs their artistic value.9 The emphasis in this book on the importance of metaphor and other forms of " warm" argument for legal change supplies a further argument against sharply distinguishing rational from emotive expression and can even be thought to argue for defining speech more broadly than courts have as yet done, so that it would encompass the burning of draft cards and other expressive activity now classified as "action" rather than as "speech." 1II The danger of warm rhetoric is that it will become hot-by which I refer not to burning one's draft card but to attacking one's opponents physically. Violence is a way of getting people to alter their perspectives, and despite all its emphasis on unforced inquiry pragmatism has difficulty drawing and defending the line between peaceable and forcible means of changing the way people think. But the pragmatist will not be insensitive to the costs of free speech, including the costs of providing police protection at public expense to speakers who desire to provoke violence. <br><br>
Although American lawyers have made significant contributions to the theory of free speech, their attitude toward law itself is pious and reverential rather than inquiring and challenging. Law is not a sacred text, however, but a usually humdrum social practice vaguely bounded by ethical and political convictions. The soundness of legal interpretations and other legal propositions is best gauged, therefore, by an examination of their consequences in the world of fact. That is a central contention of this book. In making it I do not mean to deny that the legal tradition includes insights and sensitivities of great social value. The rule of law is a genuine, indeed an invaluable, public good, and one to which formalists like Coke have made great contributions. The refusal to acknowledge these contributions is one of the flaws of critical legal studies.<br><br>
But there is a tendency in law to look backward rather than forward to search for essences rather than to embrace the experiential flux. The consequences of law are what are least well known about law.<br><br>
The profession's indifference to studies that cast doubt on the lawyer's faith in the expressive, symbolic, and norm-reinforcing consequences of law is appalling.<br><br>
The situation is unlikely to be changed (to continue the religious metaphor) by preaching. It is deeply rooted in the nature of legal education, which in turn reflects the age-old practices and traditions of the profession.<br><br>
Judges and lawyers do not have the leisure or the training to conduct systematic investigations of the causes and consequences of law.<br><br>
That is work for the academy. But the law schools conceive their function to be the training of legal professionals rather than legal scientists.<br><br>
(There are good economic reasons for this. ) The emphasis is on imparting the skills, knowledge, and folkways most essential to the effective practice of law, and that means the skills of doctrinal analysis and legal argumentation, knowledge of legal doctrines, and the folkways of the judge and practicing lawyer.<br><br>
I mentioned in the Introduction that the study of law is begun in medias res, and here I add that this procedure forestalls the emergence of a critical, an external, perspective. It presents law as something not to be questioned, as something that has always existed and in approximately its contemporary form. Within a few months of entering law school the law student has lost the external perspective. There is very little postgraduate legal education in this country other than for foreigners, and little effort is made to equip the law student who may one day become a law professor with the skills, knowledge, and attitudes requisite for studying the causes of law, the direct and indirect consequences of law on behavior, the experience of other nations with law, and the scientific laws of the legal system. Skills of mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, survey research, and experimentation; knowledge of legal institutions here and abroad and of the pertinent parts of the disciplines (economics, political science, statistics, philosophy, psychology) that bear on law; the scientific ethic-all these are for the most part ignored. This neglect is the obverse of the law schools' preoccupation with imparting skills of immediate use in the practice of law. It is no surprise that so much legal scholarship and judicial analysis is unoriginal, unempirical, conventional, and unworldly, overwhelmingly verbal and argumentative (indeed, verbose and polemical) , narrowly focused on doctrinal questions, mesmerized by the latest Supreme Court decisions, and preoccupied with minute and ephemeral distinctions-rather than bold, scientific, and descriptive. The academy does not generate the knowledge that judges, lawyers, and legislators need in order to operate a modern legal system, yet there is no other institution capable of generating it. Unless these grave deficiencies of academic law are overcome, ambitious programs for improving law are unlikely to succeed.<br><br>
Let us begin to recognize the problems by noting that a carapace of falsity and pretense surrounds law and is obscuring the enterprise. It is time we got rid of it. I end as I began with a quotation from William Butler Yeats-this one, from "A Coat," made apt by the importance of the robe as a judicial symbol: "there's more enterprise In walking naked."<br><br>


#1 . Obviously "rightness" here is being used in the second of two senses relevant to law: that is, with reference to substantive justice, justice in the individual case, rather than formal justice, which emphasizes systemic concerns such as adherence to precedent. The disvaluing of the second sense is a defining feature of critical legal studies and other radical theories of law.#<br><br>
#2. And one mirrored on the practical level i n the extraordinary diversity of interpretive approaches found in judicial opinions. It is diffi cult for even a supreme court to bring about uniformity of interpretive approach, because ordinarily the interpretive theory in a j udicial opinion is j ust dictum. The case would, or at least plausibly could, have come out the same way on a different theory, making the particular theory articulated dispensable, and therefore dictum.#<br><br>
#3. See, for example, Federal Judicial Center, Report of the Study Group on the Case Load of the Sliprelne COllrl ( 1 972); Note, "Of High Designs: A Compendium of Proposals to Reduce the Workload of the Supreme Court," 97 Harvard Law Review 307 ( 1983) ; Arthur D. Hellman, "Caseload, Conflicts, and Decisional Capacity: Does the Supreme Court Need Help?" 67 judicatllre 28 ( 1983).#<br><br>
#4. See generally Sanford Levinson, Constitutional Faith ( 1988). One potentially constructive overlap is the lawyer's and the theologian's common interest in practical reason. In Chapter 2 I cited Cardinal Newman's Grammar of Assent; here I add Nicholas Rescher, Pascal's Wager: A Study of Practical Reasoning in Philosophical Theology ( 1985) .#<br><br>
#5. Holmes's p rophecy of 1 897 is in process of being fulfilled at long last: "For the rational study of the law the black-letter man may be the man of the present, but the man of the future is the man of statistics and the master of economics . . . I look forward to the time when the part played by history in the explanation of dogma shall be very small, and instead of ingenious [historical] research we shall spend our energy on a study of the ends sought to be attained and the reasons for desiring them. As a step toward that ideal it seems to me that every lawyer ought to seek an understanding of economics . . . In the present state of political economy . . . we are called on to consider and weigh the ends of legislation, the means of attaining them, and the cost. We learn that for everything we have to give up something else, and we are taught to set the advantage we gain against the other advantage we lose, and to know what we are doing when we elect." "The Path of the Law," 10 Harvard Law Review 457, 469, 474 ( 1897).<br><br>
6. See C . Edwin Baker, " Scope of the First Amendment Freedom of Speech," 25 UCLA Law Review 964, 974-981 ( 1978).<br><br>
7. As powerfully argued in Peter Munz, Our Knowledge of the Growth of Knowledge: Popper or Wittgenstein? ( 1985) .<br><br>
8. These are views propounded by Frederick Schauer. See Free Speech: A Philosophical Inquiry 32-33 ( 1982) ; "Liars, Novelists, and the Law of Defamation," 51 Brooklyn Law Review 233, 266 ( 1985) . Schauer does note with approval that fallibilist theories of science support the epistemic case for a free market in ideas. See Free Speech: A Philosophical Inquir above, at 25. But on the whole he is skeptical about that case.<br><br>
9. This argument is developed in Richard A . Posner, "Art for Law's Sake, " 58 American Scholar 513 ( 1989). to. While adhering to its earlier ruling upholding punishment of draft-card burning, the Supreme Court has now ruled that flag burning is constitutionally protected. See Texas v. Johnson, 1 09 S . Ct. 2533 ( 1989).#<br><br>
